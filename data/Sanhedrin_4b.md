## Annotated Text (Bold Only)

You say vocalization is authoritative, Rather, everyone vocalization is authoritative.

But Rabbi and the Rabbis disagree with regard to this: Rabbi holds “the court shall condemn” other the Rabbis hold “shall condemn” these those And Rabbi **Yehuda ben Roetz**`[PERSON]`, the Rabbis do not disagree with him, **Beit Hillel**`[person]`, as it is taught “And shall make atonement shall make atonement “And shall make atonement due to the logical inference: Could this not inference?

is stated blood below, and is stated blood above, Just as blood that is stated below, when it is presented with **one**`[CARDINAL]` presentation it has effected atonement, so too blood that is stated above, when it is presented with **one**`[CARDINAL]` presentation it has effected atonement.

Or go this way, is stated blood with regard to the external and is stated blood with regard to inner Just as blood that was stated concerning inner one of the presentations is lacking it has not accomplished anything so too, blood that was stated concerning the external of the presentations is lacking it has accomplished nothing.

Let us see to which this is similar.

We derive external from external

but we do not derive external from inner Or go this way: We derive sin-offering **four**`[CARDINAL]` corners from a sin-offering **four**`[CARDINAL]` corners and this which is not a sin-offering **four**`[CARDINAL]` corners cannot prove the verse states: “And shall make atonement,” “And shall make atonement,” “And shall make atonement,” due to the logical inference.

shall make atonement,” even though he presented **only three**`[CARDINAL]` shall make atonement,” even though he presented **only two**`[CARDINAL]` shall make atonement,” even though he presented **only one**`[CARDINAL]` And Rabbi **Shimon**`[person]` and the Rabbis, with regard to this they disagree: Rabbi **Shimon**`[person]` holds the roofing [sekhakha] does not need a verse

And the Rabbis hold roofing does need a verse.

And Rabbi **Akiva**`[person]` and the Rabbis, with regard to this they disagree: Rabbi **Akiva**`[person]` holds “bodies” indicates **two**`[CARDINAL]`.

And the Rabbis hold “bodies” indicates general And does everyone vocalization is authoritative?

But isn’t it taught for totafot for **totafot**`[person]` for **totafot**`[person]` There are **four**`[CARDINAL]` here, the statement of **Rabbi Yishmael**`[person]`.

Rabbi **Akiva**`[person]` says: There is no need tat in **Katfei**`[place]` **two**`[CARDINAL]`, pat in Afriki **two**`[CARDINAL]`, Rather, actually disagree And this statement, that they disagree where the vocalization differs from the tradition But this milk [ḥalev] and fat [ḥelev] are an identical vocalization is authoritative.

But “Shall see” “shall appear” are an identical and disagree As it is taught **Yoḥanan ben Dahavai**`[person]` says in the name of Rabbi **Yehuda ben**`[PERSON]` Teima:

**One**`[CARDINAL]` who is blind in one of his eyes is exempt from the appearance, as it is stated: yireh, Shall see, yera’eh, Shall appear.

in the manner that one comes to see, so he comes to appear, Just as to see with both of one’s eyes, so too, to appear with both his eyes.

Rather, **Rav Aḥa**`[person]`, son of **Rav Ika**`[person]`, said: the verse states: “You shall not cook a young goat” the **Torah**`[concept]` prohibited the manner of cooking, The Sages taught monetary law by **three**`[CARDINAL]`
