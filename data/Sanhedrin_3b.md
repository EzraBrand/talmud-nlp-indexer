that is not paid according to its value, he also taught **half**`[CARDINAL]` the damage, which is money that is not paid according to its value, And since he needs to teach **half**`[CARDINAL]` the damage, he also taught damage.

From where do we **three**`[CARDINAL]` as the Sages taught: “The owner of the house shall come near the court, there is one here.

“The cause of both parties shall come before the court,” there are **two**`[CARDINAL]` here.

“He whom the court shall condemn there are **three**`[CARDINAL]` here, the statement of Rabbi **Yoshiya**`[person]`.

Rabbi **Yonatan**`[person]` says: The **first**`[ORDINAL]` is stated **first**`[ORDINAL]` And one does not derive **first**`[ORDINAL]` Rather, “The cause of both parties shall come before the court,” there is one here, “He whom the court shall condemn” there are **two**`[CARDINAL]` here.

And a court may not an even they add an additional one to them, there are **three**`[CARDINAL]` here.

Let us say disagree with regard to **one**`[CARDINAL]` derives **first**`[ORDINAL]` As Sage, holds **one**`[CARDINAL]` derives **first**`[ORDINAL]` and Sage, holds one does not derive **first**`[ORDINAL]` No, everyone one does not derive **first**`[ORDINAL]` Rabbi **Yoshiya**`[person]` said to you: If it is true let the verse say: The owner of the house shall come near to the judge

[hashofet].

What, “To the court [haelohim]”?

Conclude from it to the tally.

And **Rabbi Yonatan**`[person]` employed the language of the world, as people say: **One**`[CARDINAL]` who has a case, should approach the judge, But doesn’t Rabbi **Yoshiya**`[person]` accept a court an odd And isn’t it taught **Rabbi Eliezer**`[person]`, son of **Rabbi Yosei HaGelili**`[person]`, says: What the verse states: “To incline after a multitude to pervert justice” the **Torah**`[concept]` is saying Make for yourself a court incline holds in accordance with **Rabbi Yehuda**`[person]`, who says: **seventy**`[CARDINAL]` As we learned **Great Sanhedrin**`[person]` was of **seventy\-one**`[CARDINAL]` Rabbi **Yehuda**`[person]` says: **seventy Say**`[CARDINAL]` that you heard **Rabbi Yehuda**`[person]` to **the Great Sanhedrin**`[place]`, which verses are written, Have you heard him with regard to the rest of the courts, And if you would say: There is no difference; but didn’t we learn laying of hands by the Sages and the breaking of the heifer’s neck of **three**`[CARDINAL]` the statement of Rabbi **Shimon**`[person]`.

Rabbi **Yehuda**`[person]` says: of **five**`[CARDINAL]` And we say What is the reasoning of Rabbi **Yehuda**`[person]`?

“Shall lay their hands,” **two**`[CARDINAL]`, “Elders,” **two**`[CARDINAL]`, And a court may not an even we add another one to them, there are **five**`[CARDINAL]` here.

that Rabbi **Yoshiya**`[person]` of Rabbi **Yehuda**`[person]` goes further than because **Rabbi Yehuda**`[person]` does not accept with **a Great Sanhedrin**`[place]`, but with regard to other courts he does accept And Rabbi **Yoshiya**`[person]` also does not accept with regard to other courts.

And what does he do with this “To incline interprets it in capital law.

But does not with regard to monetary law?

But that which we learned **two**`[CARDINAL]` say exempt and one says liable, exempt; **two**`[CARDINAL]` say liable and one says exempt, liable.

Let us say that not in accordance with Rabbi **Yoshiya**`[person]`, You even say Rabbi **Yoshiya**`[person]`.

He derives this on an a fortiori from capital law: If capital law, which are strict, the Merciful **One**`[CARDINAL]` states Follow the majority, monetary law, not all the more so The Sages taught: monetary law by **three**`[CARDINAL]` Rabbi says: by **five**`[CARDINAL]` so that a verdict can be issued with **three**`[CARDINAL]` Is that to say of **three**`[CARDINAL]` a verdict cannot be issued by **two**`[CARDINAL]` This is is saying: due to that a verdict by **three**`[CARDINAL]`.

Evidently, holds when **three**`[CARDINAL]` is written is written with regard to the verdict.

Rabbi **Abbahu**`[person]` ridicule [**megaddef**`[person]` ] this If that is so, **the Great Sanhedrin**`[place]` would need **141**`[CARDINAL]` so that the verdict can be issued by **seventy\-one**`[CARDINAL]`, and a lesser **Sanhedrin**`[concept]` would need **forty\-five**`[CARDINAL]` so that the verdict can be issued by **twenty\-three**`[CARDINAL]`.

Rather, the Merciful **One**`[CARDINAL]` states: “Gather Me seventy men from the time of gathering, **seventy**`[DATE]`.

“And the congregation shall judge…and the congregation shall save” also from the time that the congregation judges Similarly, “The owner of the house shall come near to the court” from the time of coming near **three**`[CARDINAL]` Rather, this is the reasoning of Rabbi “He whom the court shall condemn” **two**`[CARDINAL]` it is stated: “The court,” below and it is stated: “The court,” above.

Just as below **two**`[CARDINAL]` so too above two And a court may not an even they add another one to them, so there are **five**`[CARDINAL]` here.
