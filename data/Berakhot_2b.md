## Annotated Text (Bold Only)

Perhaps the setting of light.

what does and it is purified mean?

the person will become purified.

Rabba bar **Rav Sheila**`[person]` said: If so, let the verse say And he will become purified.

What is And it is purified?

**the day**`[DATE]` is pure, as people say The sun has set and **the day**`[DATE]` is purified.

In the **West**`[place]`, they did not hear this by **Rabba**`[person]` bar **Rav Sheila**`[person]`.

They raised the dilemma: Does the expression: And the sun sets, refer to the setting of the sun, and does:

And it is purified, mean **the day**`[DATE]` clears away?

Or perhaps it refers to the setting of its light what is And it is purified?

the purification of the person.

Ultimately they resolved from a baraita.

It was taught in a baraita a sign for which is the emergence of the stars.

derive from here the complete sunset, and the expression “and it is purified” the day clears away, the Master said: From the time when the priests enter to partake of their teruma.

raises a contradiction From when a poor person enters to eat his bread with salt until he rises from his meal.

The latter clause certainly disagrees with our mishna.

the **first**`[ORDINAL]` clause shall we say that it disagrees with our mishna?

No, the poor person and the priest are **one**`[CARDINAL]` time.

raises a contradiction From when does **one**`[CARDINAL]` begin to recite in the evening?

From the time when people enter to eat their bread on **Shabbat eve**`[DATE]`.

the statement of **Rabbi Meir**`[person]`.

the Rabbis say: From the time when the priests are eligible to partake of their teruma, a sign for which is the emergence of the stars.

And although there is no proof there is an allusion it is stated “And we perform the work, and **half**`[CARDINAL]` of them grasp their spears from dawn until the emergence of the stars” And it says: “That in the night they may be a guard to us, and may labor in **the day**`[DATE]`”

What And it says?

As, if you say that night begins when the sun sets, but stayed late and arrived early; Come and hear, “That in the night they may be a guard to us, and may labor in **the day**`[DATE]`,” It might enter your mind poor person people are **one**`[CARDINAL]` time, if you say the poor person’s and the priest are **one**`[CARDINAL]` time, the Rabbis is **Rabbi Meir**`[person]`.

Rather, learn from this a separate time poor person and a separate time priest.

no, poor person and the priest are **one**`[CARDINAL]` time, the poor person and people are not the same.

And is the time of the poor person and the priest the same?

raises a contradiction From when does **one**`[CARDINAL]` begin to recite **evening**`[TIME]` From the time when **the day**`[DATE]` becomes sanctified on **the eve of Shabbat**`[DATE]`, this is the statement of **Rabbi Eliezer**`[person]`, Rabbi **Yehoshua**`[person]`, says: From the time when the priests are eligible to partake of their teruma.

Rabbi **Meir**`[person]` says: from when the priests immerse themselves in order to partake of their teruma.

Rabbi **Yehuda**`[person]` said to Do the priests not immerse themselves during **the day**`[DATE]`, **Rabbi Ḥanina**`[person]` says when the poor person enters to eat his bread with salt.

Rabbi Aḥai, and some say **Rabbi Aḥa**`[person]`, says: From the time when most people enter to recline if you say the time of the poor person and the priest are **one**`[CARDINAL]` time, **Rabbi Ḥanina**`[person]` is **Rabbi Yehoshua**`[person]`.

Rather, must not conclude from this the time for poor person is separate and the time for priest is separate?

conclude from this.

which **one**`[CARDINAL]` is later?

it is reasonable the poor person is later.

As if you say the poor person is earlier, **Rabbi Ḥanina**`[person]` is Rabbi **Eliezer**`[PERSON]`.

Rather, must not conclude from this that the poor person is later?

conclude from this.

the Master said **Rabbi Yehuda**`[person]` said Do the priests not immerse themselves during **the day**`[DATE]`?

What Rabbi **Yehuda**`[person]` said to **Rabbi Meir**`[person]` seems correct, **Rabbi Meir**`[person]` said as follows Do you maintain that I am speaking of your twilight?

I am speaking of **Rabbi Yosei**`[person]`’s twilight, as **Rabbi Yosei**`[person]` said: Twilight is like the blink of an eye; begins and ends and it is impossible to quantify.
