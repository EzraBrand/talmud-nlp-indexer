  "en_text": "<b>You</b> therefore <b>say</b> in response: The <b>vocalization</b> of the Torah <b>is authoritative,</b> and the verse prohibits cooking the young goat in its mother’s milk. <b>Rather, everyone</b> agrees that the <b>vocalization</b> of the Torah <b>is authoritative. But</b> in actuality, <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>and the Rabbis disagree with regard to this: Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds</b> that the phrase <b>“the court shall condemn”</b> is referring to <b>other</b> judges, in addition to the three that were derived from the earlier verse, leading to a total of five, whereas <b>the Rabbis hold</b> that the term <b>“shall condemn”</b> means <b>these</b> judges, i.e., <b>those</b> who have already been mentioned, and therefore there are only three. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Roetz,</b> who applied the principle: The vocalization of the Torah is authoritative, to the question of the duration of the ritual impurity of a woman who gave birth to a female, it can be explained that <b>the Rabbis do not disagree with him,</b> as everyone agrees that the vocalization of the Torah is authoritative. With regard to <b>Beit Hillel,</b> who hold that a single presentation of blood is sufficient to atone even when bringing a sin-offering, this is not because they hold the traditional consonantal text is authoritative. Rather, their opinion is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the sin-offering brought by a ruler: <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall make atonement</b> for him” (Leviticus 4:26), and with regard to a sin-offering of a goat brought by an ordinary person: “And the priest <b>shall make atonement</b> for him” (Leviticus 4:31), and with regard to a sin-offering of a lamb brought by an ordinary person: <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall make atonement</b> for him” (Leviticus 4:35), repeating this term three times. This repetition is <b>due to the</b> following <b>logical inference:</b> <b>Could this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>not</b> be derived through an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference?</b> There <b>is stated</b> a term of <b>blood below,</b> in the verse written with regard to a bird brought as a sin-offering (see Leviticus 5:9), <b>and</b> there <b>is stated</b> a term of <b>blood above,</b> in the verse written with regard to an animal brought as a sin-offering (see Leviticus 4:25, 31, 35). <b>Just as</b> with regard to the <b>blood that is stated below, when it is presented with one presentation it has effected atonement, so too</b> with regard to the <b>blood that is stated above, when it is presented with one presentation it has effected atonement.</b> <b>Or</b> perhaps <b>go this way,</b> offering a different explanation: There <b>is stated</b> a term of <b>blood</b> in the verse written <b>with regard to the external</b> altar, i.e., in the verse written with regard to a sin-offering of an ordinary person that is brought on the external altar in the courtyard (see Leviticus 4:25), <b>and</b> there <b>is stated</b> a term of <b>blood</b> in the verse written <b>with regard to</b> the <b>inner</b> altar, i.e., with regard to a sin-offering of the community or the High Priest, the blood of which is sprinkled on the incense altar inside the Sanctuary (see Leviticus 4:7, 18). <b>Just as</b> with regard to the <b>blood that was stated concerning</b> the <b>inner</b> altar, i.e., if <b>one of the presentations is lacking it has not accomplished anything</b> and the offering is not valid, <b>so too,</b> with regard to the <b>blood that was stated concerning the external</b> altar, if one <b>of the presentations is lacking it has accomplished nothing.</b> The Gemara analyzes the two possibilities: <b>Let us see to which</b> of the two comparisons <b>this is</b> more <b>similar.</b> It can be claimed: <b>We derive</b> a <i>halakha</i> stated with regard to the <b>external</b> altar <b>from</b> a <i>halakha</i> stated with regard to the <b>external</b> altar, <b>but we do not derive</b> a <i>halakha</i> stated with regard to the <b>external</b> altar <b>from</b> a <i>halakha</i> stated with regard to the <b>inner</b> altar. <b>Or go this way: We derive</b> a <i>halakha</i> stated with regard to a <b>sin-offering</b> whose blood is to be sprinkled on the <b>four corners</b> of the altar <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> stated with regard to <b>a sin-offering</b> whose blood is to be sprinkled on the <b>four corners</b> of the altar, <b>and this</b> sin-offering consisting of a bird, <b>which is not a sin-offering</b> of the type whose blood is to be sprinkled on the <b>four corners</b> of the altar, <b>cannot prove</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is similar with regard to a sin-offering whose blood is to be sprinkled on the four corners of the altar. Since there are two legitimate inferences, the <i>halakha</i> cannot be decided through a logical inference. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And</b> the priest <b>shall make atonement,” “And</b> the priest <b>shall make atonement,” “And</b> the priest <b>shall make atonement,”</b> three times, <b>due to the logical inference.</b> The verses are interpreted as follows: “The priest <b>shall make atonement,” even though he presented only three</b> presentations, and then a second verse repeats: “The priest <b>shall make atonement,” even though he presented only two</b> presentations, and then a third verse repeats: “The priest <b>shall make atonement,” even though he presented only one</b> presentation. This interpretation is the source of Beit Hillel’s opinion. <b>And</b> concerning <b>Rabbi Shimon and the Rabbis,</b> who disagreed with regard to the number of walls required in a <i>sukka</i>, it is <b>with regard to this</b> that <b>they disagree: Rabbi Shimon holds</b> that <b>the</b> basic requirement of placing <b>roofing [<i>sekhakha</i>]</b> on the <i>sukka</i> <b>does not need a verse</b> to teach that it is required, as it is implied by the word <i>sukka</i>. Consequently, the word <i>sukkot</i> appears two times in the text beyond the initial mitzva, teaching a requirement for four walls, and there is a <i>halakha</i> transmitted to Moses from Sinai that reduces the minimum size of one of the walls to a handbreadth. <b>And the Rabbis hold</b> that the requirement of placing <b>roofing does need a verse.</b> Therefore, one of the four derivations is used to teach that requirement, and only three walls remain, one of which is reduced to a handbreadth. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>Rabbi Akiva and the Rabbis,</b> who disagreed about the issue of a quarter<i>-log</i> of blood that emanated from two corpses, it is <b>with regard to this</b> that <b>they disagree: Rabbi Akiva holds</b> that <b>“bodies”</b> in plural <b>indicates two.</b> Consequently, a quarter<i>-log</i> of blood that emanated from two corpses also renders one impure. <b>And the Rabbis hold</b> that <b>“bodies”</b> in plural <b>indicates</b> a <b>general</b> <i>halakha</i>, and no derivation can be made with regard to blood that emanated from two corpses. Both opinions, however, agree that the vocalized text of the Torah is authoritative. The Gemara asks: <b>And does everyone</b> actually hold that the <b>vocalization</b> of the Torah <b>is authoritative? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the number of compartments in the phylacteries of the head, the verse states: “It shall be for a sign upon your hand, and <b>for <i>totafot</i></b> between your eyes” (Exodus 13:16), with the word <i>totafot</i> spelled deficient, without a second <i>vav</i>, in a way that can be read as singular; and again: “They shall be <b>for <i>totafot</i></b> between your eyes” (Deuteronomy 6:8), spelled as a singular word; and again: “They shall be <b>for <i>totafot</i></b> between your eyes” (11:18), this time spelled plene, with a second <i>vav</i>, in a manner that must be plural? <b>There are four</b> mentions of <i>totafot</i> <b>here,</b> as the third one is written in the plural and therefore counts as two. Consequently, it is derived that the phylacteries of the head must have four compartments. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael.</b> <b>Rabbi Akiva says: There is no need</b> for this proof, as the requirement of four compartments can be derived from the word <i>totafot</i> itself: The word <b><i>tat</i> in</b> the language of the <b><i>Katfei</i></b> means <b>two,</b> and the word <b><i>pat</i> in</b> the language of <b><i>Afriki</i></b> also means <b>two,</b> and therefore <i>totafot</i> can be understood as a compound word meaning: Four. The <i>baraita</i> therefore indicates that Rabbi Yishmael holds that not the vocalization but rather the tradition of the manner in which the verses in the Torah are written is authoritative. <b>Rather,</b> the explanation that everyone holds that the vocalization of the Torah is authoritative must be rejected, and it must be explained that the Sages <b>actually</b> do <b>disagree</b> whether it is the vocalization of the Torah or the tradition of the manner in which the verses in the Torah are written that is authoritative. <b>And</b> in order to explain the unresolved problem with regard to the <i>baraita</i> about the prohibition of cooking a young goat in its mother’s milk, the explanation is that <b>this statement, that they disagree</b> as to whether the vocalization or the tradition is authoritative, applies <b>where the vocalization</b> of the word <b>differs from the tradition</b> of the manner in which the word is written. <b>But</b> in <b>this</b> case the words <b>milk [<i>ḥalev</i>] and fat [<i>ḥelev</i>] are</b> written in <b>an identical</b> manner, as there is no difference in the writing at all, only in the way they are vocalized. Therefore, all agree that the <b>vocalization</b> of the Torah <b>is authoritative.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> the words: <b>“Shall see”</b> and <b>“shall appear” are</b> written in <b>an identical</b> matter, <b>and</b> nevertheless the Sages <b>disagree</b> about which reading is authoritative. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Yoḥanan ben Dahavai says in the name of Rabbi Yehuda ben Teima: One who is blind in one of his eyes is exempt from the</b> mitzva of <b>appearance,</b> i.e., the obligation to appear in the Temple and to sacrifice an offering on the three pilgrimage Festivals, <b>as it is stated:</b> “Three times in the year all your males shall appear [<i>yera’eh</i>] before the Lord God” (Exodus 23:17). According to the way in which the verse is written, without vocalization, it can be read as <b><i>yireh</i>,</b> meaning: <b>Shall see,</b> instead of <b><i>yera’eh</i>,</b> meaning: <b>Shall appear.</b> This teaches that <b>in the</b> same <b>manner that one comes to see, so he comes to appear,</b> i.e., to be seen: <b>Just as</b> the usual way <b>to see</b> is <b>with both of one’s eyes, so too,</b> the obligation <b>to appear</b> applies only to one who comes <b>with</b> the sight of <b>both his eyes.</b> It is therefore apparent that even when there is no difference in the way the words are written, some say that the tradition, not the vocalization, is authoritative. <b>Rather, Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, said:</b> The reason all agree that there is a prohibition to cook a young goat in its mother’s milk and not in its mother’s fat is that <b>the verse states: “You shall not cook a young goat”</b> (Exodus 23:19). The verse teaches that the action <b>the Torah prohibited</b> is in <b>the manner of cooking,</b> which is generally done in a liquid such as milk and not in a solid substance such as fat. § <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Cases of <b>monetary law</b> are adjudicated <b>by three</b> judges.",
