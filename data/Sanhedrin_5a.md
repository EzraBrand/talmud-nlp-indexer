But if was an expert for the public, he may judge even lone **Rav Naḥman**`[person]` said: such as I may judge monetary law as lone And similarly, Rabbi **Ḥiyya**`[person]` said: such as I may judge monetary law as lone A dilemma was raised before Such as I, that I have studied and extrapolate and have received permission But has not received permission his judgment is not judgment?

Or perhaps even though he did not receive permission his judgment is judgment?

Come hear **Mar Zutra**`[person]`, son of **Rav Naḥman**`[person]`, adjudicated case and erred he came before **Rav Yosef**`[person]` said to him: If accepted you upon themselves you are not pay

But if not go pay learn from it where one did not receive permission his ruling is judgment.

Learn from it **Rav**`[person]` says: **One**`[CARDINAL]` who wants to adjudicate a case and wants to be exempt if he errs must receive permission from the **Exilarch**`[concept]` And similarly, **Shmuel**`[person]` says: he must receive permission from the **Exilarch**`[concept]`. obvious from here to here, and from there to there, is effective.

And from here to there, is also effective, since here a scepter, and there a staff, as it is taught “The scepter shall not depart from **Judah**`[GPE]`”; these are the **Exilarchs**`[person]` in **Babylonia**`[place]`, who subjugate the **Jewish**`[NORP]` people with a scepter.

“Nor the ruler’s staff from **between his feet**`[QUANTITY]`”; These are the grandchildren of **Hillel**`[GPE]` who teach **Torah**`[concept]` in public, from there, to here what Come hear that **Rabba**`[person]` bar **Ḥana**`[person]` adjudicated a case and erred.

He came before Rabbi **Ḥiyya**`[person]` said to him: If accepted you upon themselves, you are not pay but if not, go pay.

But **Rabba**`[person]` bar **Ḥana**`[person]` received permission learn from from there to here is not effective.

Learn from it And not effective?

But when **Rabba**`[person]` bar **Rav Huna**`[person]` was in a dispute with the the house of the **Exilarch**`[concept]` he said: not from you I received permission I received permission from my father, my master, and my father, my master, from **Rav**`[person]`, and **Rav**`[person]` from Rabbi Ḥiyya, and Rabbi **Ḥiyya**`[person]` from Rabbi He was standing up to them with words alone, But since is not effective why did **Rabba**`[person]` bar **Ḥana**`[person]` receive permission for the cities that stand on the borders What permission?

When **Rabba**`[person]` bar **Ḥana**`[person]` descended to **Babylonia**`[place]`, Rabbi **Ḥiyya**`[person]` said to Rabbi

My brother’s son is descending to **Babylonia**`[place]`.

**May**`[DATE]` he teach He may teach.

**May**`[DATE]` he adjudicate He may adjudicate.

**May**`[DATE]` he declare a firstborn permitted?

He may declare permitted.

when **Rav**`[person]`, descended to **Babylonia**`[place]`, Rabbi **Ḥiyya**`[person]` said to Rabbi

My sister’s son is descending to **Babylonia**`[place]`.

**May**`[DATE]` he teach He may teach.

**May**`[DATE]` he adjudicate He may adjudicate.

**May**`[DATE]` he declare a firstborn permitted?

He may not declare permitted.

What is different concerning this Sage, that called him: My brother’s son, and what is different concerning that Sage, that called him: My sister’s son?

And if you would say that this was situation: but doesn’t the Master say: **Aivu**`[person]`, and **Ḥana**`[person]`, and **Sheila**`[person]`, and **Marta**`[person]`, and **Rabbi Ḥiyya**`[person]`, were all sons of **Abba**`[person]` bar **Aḥa Karsala**`[person]` from **Kafrei**`[place]`?

Rav his brother’s son who was his sister’s son, **Rabba**`[person]` bar **Ḥana**`[person]` was his brother’s son who was not his sister’s son.

And if you wish, say
