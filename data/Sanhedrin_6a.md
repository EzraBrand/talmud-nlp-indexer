And if you would say the Rabbis disagree with Rabban **Shimon ben Gamliel**`[PERSON]` but doesn’t Rabbi Abbahu say: **two**`[CARDINAL]` that adjudicated monetary law everyone agrees their judgment is not judgment, Are you setting man against man?

the itself: **Rabbi Abbahu**`[person]` says: **two**`[CARDINAL]` that adjudicated monetary law everyone agrees their judgment is not judgment.

Rabbi **Abba**`[person]` raised an objection to **Rabbi Abbahu**`[person]` adjudicated law and exonerated the liable, or deemed liable the exempt, deemed impure that which is pure, deemed pure that which is impure, what he did is done, And pays from his house, Here we are dealing with which accepted upon themselves, If so, why pay from his house?

because they said to him: Adjudicate for us **Torah**`[concept]` law.

**Rav Safra**`[person]` said to Rabbi **Abba**`[person]`: when erred in what If we say that erred in a matter Mishna, But doesn’t **Rav Sheshet**`[person]` say Rabbi **Ami**`[PERSON]` says: erred in a matter Mishna, revoked Rather, where erred in deliberation.

What are the circumstances in deliberation?

**Rav Pappa**`[person]` said: for example, **two**`[CARDINAL]` tanna’im or **two**`[CARDINAL]` amora’im who disagree with **one**`[CARDINAL]` another, and the halakha was not stated with Sage or with Sage; and the standard practice in accordance with **one**`[CARDINAL]` of them, and he went and executed in accordance with the other this is deliberation.

Let us say is parallel to tanna’im, Mediation by **three**`[CARDINAL]` the statement of **Rabbi Meir**`[person]`.

And the Rabbis say: Compromise by a single assumed everyone we compare compromise to judgment, What, is it not they disagree in this that Sage, holds judgment by **three**`[CARDINAL]` and Sage, holds judgment by **two**`[CARDINAL]` No, that everyone judgment by **three**`[CARDINAL]` and here, they disagree with regard to this Sage, holds we compare compromise to judgment, and Sage, holds we do not compare compromise to judgment.

Let say **three**`[CARDINAL]` tanna’im with regard to compromise, as Sage, holds by **three**`[CARDINAL]` and Sage, holds by **two**`[CARDINAL]` and Sage, holds by a single **Rav Aḥa**`[person]`, son of **Rav Ika**`[person]`, and some say Rabbi **Yeimar**`[person]` bar Shelamya, said: The one who says **two**`[CARDINAL]` even one.

And that he says **two**`[CARDINAL]` that there would be witnesses to **Rav Ashi**`[person]` says: Learn from compromise does not require acquisition, As if it enters your mind requires acquisition according to the one who says requires why do I **three**`[CARDINAL]` Let it suffice with **two**`[CARDINAL]` and let perform an act of acquisition with But the halakha a compromise requires acquisition The Sages taught Just as judgment by **three**`[CARDINAL]` so mediation by **three**`[CARDINAL]`
