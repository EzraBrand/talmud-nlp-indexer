## Annotated Text (Bold Only)

If one is a **Torah**`[concept]` scholar, he need not **Abaye**`[person]` said: Even a **Torah**`[concept]` scholar must recite **at least one**`[CARDINAL]` verse of prayer, such as: “Into Your hand I trust my spirit; You have redeemed me, Lord, God of truth”

**Rabbi Levi**`[person]` bar **Ḥama**`[person]` said Rabbi **Shimon ben Lakish**`[PERSON]` said: **One**`[CARDINAL]` should always incite his good inclination against his evil inclination, as it is stated: "Tremble, and do not sin."

If subdues excellent, if not study **Torah**`[concept]`, the verse: “Say to your heart.”

If subdues excellent; if not, he should recite **Shema**`[concept]`, as it is stated “Upon your bed,” If subdues excellent; if not, he should remind himself of **the day**`[DATE]` of death, the verse: “And be still, **Selah**`[person]`.”

And **Rabbi Levi**`[person]` bar **Ḥama**`[person]` said Rabbi **Shimon ben Lakish**`[PERSON]` said: and I will give you the stone tablets and the **Torah**`[concept]` and the mitzva that I have written that you may teach them”

The “tablets” are the **ten**`[CARDINAL]` commandments the “**Torah**`[concept]`” is the **five**`[CARDINAL]` books of **Moses**`[PERSON]`.

The “mitzva” is the Mishna, “That I have written” refers to the Prophets and **Writings**`[person]`, “That you may teach them” refers to the Talmud, teaches all were given to from **Sinai**`[place]`.

Rabbi **Yitzḥak**`[person]` said: Anyone who recites **Shema**`[concept]` on his bed, it is as if he holds a double-edged sword, as it is stated: “High praises of God in their mouths, and a double-edged sword in their hands” From where is it inferred **Mar Zutra**`[person]`, and some say **Rav Ashi**`[person]`, said: from the preceding as it is written: “Let the pious exult in glory; let them joyously sing upon their beds.”

And it is written thereafter: “High praises of God in their mouths, and a double-edged sword in their hands.”

And **Rabbi Yitzḥak**`[person]` said: Anyone who recites **Shema**`[concept]` upon his bed, demons stay away from him.

as it is stated: and the sparks [reshef ] fly

[uf ] upward” fly

[uf ] nothing other than **Torah**`[concept]`, as it is stated: “Will you set your eyes upon it?

It is gone; “sparks” nothing other than demons, as it is stated: “Wasting of hunger, and the devouring of the sparks [**reshef**`[person]`] and bitter destruction [**ketev meriri**`[person]`], Rabbi **Shimon ben Lakish**`[PERSON]` said: If **one**`[CARDINAL]` engages in **Torah**`[concept]` suffering stays away from him, as it is stated: “And the sparks fly upward.” fly nothing other than **Torah**`[concept]`, as it is stated: “Will you set your eyes upon it?

It is gone; nothing other than suffering, as it is stated: “Wasting of hunger, and the devouring of the sparks,” Rabbi **Yoḥanan**`[person]` said to him: Even schoolchildren, know this as it is stated: “And He said you shall surely hear the voice of the Lord your God, and what is upright in His eyes you shall do and you shall listen to His mitzvot and guard His statutes; any disease that I have placed upon **Egypt**`[GPE]` I will not place upon you for I am the Lord your healer” Rather, Anyone who is able to engage in **Torah**`[concept]` yet does not engage the Holy One, Blessed be He, brings upon him hideous afflictions, and trouble him, as it is stated: “I was mute with silence; I was silent from good, and my pain was strong” good nothing other than **Torah**`[concept]`, as it is stated: “For I have given you a good portion, My Torah, do not abandon it” Rabbi **Zeira**`[person]`, and some say **Rabbi Ḥanina**`[person]` bar **Pappa**`[person]`, said: Come and see how the characteristics of the Holy One, Blessed be He, are unlike the characteristics of flesh and blood.

It is characteristic of flesh and blood that when **one**`[CARDINAL]` sells an object to another the seller grieves and the buyer rejoices.

With regard to the Holy One, Blessed be He, this is not so.

He gave the **Torah**`[concept]` to **Israel**`[GPE]` and rejoiced, as it is stated: “For I have given you a good portion, My Torah, do not abandon it.”

**Rava**`[person]`, and some say **Rav Ḥisda**`[person]`, said: If a person sees that suffering has befallen him, he should examine his actions.

as it is stated: “We will search and examine our ways, and return to God” If he examined found no he may attribute to dereliction of **Torah**`[concept]`.

as it is stated: “Happy is the man whom You punish, Lord, and teach out of Your law”

And if he did attribute and did not find he may be confident that these are afflictions of love, as it is stated: “For whom the Lord loves, He rebukes, **Rava**`[person]` said **Rav Seḥora**`[person]` said **Rav Huna**`[person]` said: Anyone in whom the Holy One, Blessed be He, delights, He oppresses him with suffering, as it is stated: “Yet in whom the Lord delights, He oppresses him with disease; might if he does not accept with love.

Therefore the verse teaches: “If his soul would offer itself in guilt.”

Just as a guilt-offering is brought knowingly, so too suffering knowingly.

And if one accepts what is his reward?

“That he might see his children, lengthen **his days**`[DATE]`.”

Moreover, his study will endure as it is stated: “The purpose of the Lord,” “might prosper by his hand.”

**Rabbi Ya’akov**`[person]` bar **Idi**`[person]` and **Rabbi Aḥa**`[person]` bar **Ḥanina**`[person]` disagree.

**One**`[CARDINAL]` said: Afflictions of love are any that do not cause dereliction of **Torah**`[concept]`, as it is stated: “Happy is the man whom You afflict, Lord, and teach from Your Torah.”

And one said: Afflictions of love are any that do not cause dereliction of prayer, as it is stated: “Blessed is God Who did not turn away my prayer” Rabbi **Abba**`[person]`, son of **Rabbi Ḥiyya**`[person]` bar **Abba**`[person]`, said: **Rabbi Ḥiyya**`[person]` bar **Abba**`[person]`, said **Rabbi Yoḥanan**`[person]` said as follows: Both, are afflictions of love, it is stated: “For whom He loves, He rebukes,”

What then, the verse states: “And teach him from Your Torah”?

Do not read and teach teach him rather, and teach us You teach us this from Your Torah.

an a fortiori inference from the tooth and eye The tooth and eye are a single limb of a person the slave thereby obtains his freedom; suffering that cleanses a person’s entire body all the more so

And that is Rabbi **Shimon ben Lakish**`[PERSON]`, as Rabbi **Shimon ben Lakish**`[PERSON]` said: covenant is used with regard to salt, and covenant is used with regard to afflictions.

covenant is used with regard to salt, as it is written: “The salt of the covenant should not be excluded And covenant is used with regard to afflictions, as it is written: “These are the words of the covenant” Just as, the covenant mentioned with regard to salt, the salt sweetens the meat so too the covenant mentioned with regard to suffering, the suffering cleanses a person’s transgressions, it was taught

Rabbi **Shimon ben Yoḥai**`[PERSON]` says: The Holy One, Blessed be He, gave **Israel**`[GPE]` **three**`[CARDINAL]` precious gifts, all of which were given only by means of suffering, **Torah**`[concept]`, **Eretz**`[place]` Yisrael, and the World-to-Come.

From where **Torah**`[concept]` As it is said: “Happy is the man whom You afflict, Lord,” “And teach from Your Torah.”

**Eretz**`[place]` **Yisrael**`[place]`, as it is written: “As a man rebukes his son, so the Lord your God rebukes you” and it is written thereafter: “For the Lord your God will bring you to a good land.”

The World-to-Come, as it is written: “For the mitzva is a lamp, the **Torah**`[concept]` is light, and the **reproofs**`[person]` of instruction are the way of life” A tanna taught before **Rabbi Yoḥanan:**`[PERSON]` If **one**`[CARDINAL]` engages in **Torah**`[concept]` and acts of charity
