  "en_text": "in the phylacteries of the head, where there are four separate compartments. <b>And all</b> of the verses <b>are written</b> together on one parchment <b>in</b> the phylacteries of the <b>arm,</b> which has only one compartment. Additionally, <b>Ravin bar Rav Adda said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: One who is accustomed to come to the synagogue and did not come one day, the Holy One, Blessed be He, asks about him,</b> as it were, to determine what happened to him, <b>as it is stated: “Who among you fears the Lord? Who hears the voice of His servant? Though he walks in darkness and has no light,</b> let him trust in the name of the Lord, and rely upon his God” (Isaiah 50:10). In other words, God asks, who among you fears the Lord yet did not come to hear the voice of His servant the prayer leader, who engages in the service of God? He who went out before dawn and walks in darkness before prayer. <b>If it is for a matter</b> involving <b>a mitzva that he went</b> and absented himself from prayer in the synagogue, then, despite the darkness, <b>there is light for him,</b> the aura of his mitzva will protect him. <b>But if it is for an optional matter,</b> some mundane purpose, <b>that he went</b> and absented himself from prayer in the synagogue, then, even once the day begins, <b>there is no light for him</b> (Maharsha). The verse continues: <b>“Let him trust in the name of the Lord.”</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that God is so exacting with this person? The Gemara answers: <b>Because he should have relied on the name of the Lord,</b> and trusted that he would not incur any loss if he postponed dealing with his mundane matters until after prayer in the synagogue, <b>and he did not rely</b> on God. On this same topic, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: When the Holy One, Blessed be He, enters a synagogue and does not find ten</b> people there, <b>He immediately becomes angry, as it is stated: “Why, when I came, was there no one? When I called, there was no one to answer…</b>Behold, with My rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness” (Isaiah 50:2). Concerning another aspect of the constancy of prayer, <b>Rabbi Ḥelbo said that Rav Huna said: One who sets a fixed place for his prayer, the God of Abraham assists him.</b> Since prayer parallels the Temple service, it is a sign of respect to set a fixed place for this sacred rite (Rabbi Yoshiyahu Pinto). The God of Abraham assists him because this pious custom evokes Abraham’s conduct. <b>When he dies,</b> those who eulogize one who set a fixed place for his prayer <b>say about him: “Where is the humble</b> one, <b>where is the pious</b> one, <b>of the disciples of our father Abraham?”</b> Presumably, one who sets a fixed place for prayer is a disciple of Abraham in every respect, including humility and piety (Rabbi Yoshiyahu Pinto). The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive <b>that Abraham our father set a fixed place</b> for his prayer? The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written: “And Abraham rose in the morning to the place where he had stood</b> before God” (Genesis 19:27), <b>and</b> the verb <b>“standing” means nothing other than prayer, as it is stated: “And Pinehas stood and prayed”</b> (Psalms 106:30). <b>Rabbi Ḥelbo said</b> that <b>Rav Huna said: One who leaves the synagogue should not take large strides</b> because it creates the impression that he is eager to leave. <b>Abaye</b> explained Rav Huna’s statement and <b>said:</b> This <i>halakha</i> <b>was only said</b> with regard <b>to leaving</b> the synagogue, where large strides seem particularly disrespectful. <b>However,</b> with regard <b>to entering</b> a synagogue, <b>it is a mitzva to run</b> and one is permitted to rush and take large strides (Rabbi Yoshiyahu Pinto). <b>As it is said:</b> “And let us know, <b>eagerly strive to know the Lord”</b> (Hosea 6:3). One who eagerly enters a synagogue displays his enthusiasm to follow the path of God. <b>Rabbi Zeira said: Initially, when I saw the Sages running to the</b> Rabbi’s <b>lecture on Shabbat, I said: These Sages are desecrating Shabbat.</b> One is prohibited from running on Shabbat in deference to the sanctity of the day. <b>Once I heard that which Rabbi Tanḥum said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi</b> said: <b>One should always run for a matter of <i>halakha</i>, even on Shabbat, as it is stated: “They shall walk after the Lord, who will roar like a lion”</b> (Hosea 11:10). In other words, one should rush as though he were chased by a lion (<i>Birkat Hashem</i>), <b>I too run.</b> <b>Rabbi Zeira said: The reward for</b> attending <b>the lecture is</b> for <b>running.</b> Since most individuals attending the lecture did not fully understand the material taught, the primary reward for attendance was given for their intention to hear the Torah being taught, as evidenced by their rush to arrive. Similarly, <b>Abaye said: The reward for</b> attending <b>the <i>kalla</i> is</b> for <b>the crowding.</b> Due to the large crowd, study was difficult, so the primary reward was given for their effort to hear and understand some part of the lecture. Similarly, <b>Rava said: The reward for</b> learning the halakhic <b>traditions</b> of the <i>amora’im</i> <b>is</b> for <b>the logical</b> analysis, as the primary reward for studying Talmud was not given for knowing the halakhic conclusions, but for the logical reasoning that led to those conclusions. <b>Rav Pappa said: The</b> primary <b>reward for</b> attending <b>a house of mourning [<i>bei tammaya</i>] is</b> for the <b>silence,</b> which is the optimal manner for those consoling the mourners to express their empathy. <b>Mar Zutra said: The</b> primary <b>reward for fasting is</b> for the <b>charity</b> given to the poor on the fast day (see Isaiah 58). <b>Rav Sheshet said: The</b> primary <b>reward for</b> delivering <b>a eulogy is</b> for causing those in attendance to <b>raise their voices</b> and cry, as that increases the grief over the deceased. <b>Rav Ashi said: The</b> primary <b>reward for</b> participating in <b>a wedding is</b> for <b>the words,</b> i.e., the good wishes with which the guests regale the bride and groom. Back to the topic of deference for a synagogue, the Gemara records that <b>Rav Huna said: One who prays behind the synagogue is called wicked,</b> as while the entire congregation is facing one direction to pray, he faces the opposite direction creating the impression that he is treating the synagogue and its congregation with contempt. <b>As it is stated: “The wicked walk round about,</b> when vileness is exalted among the sons of men” (Psalms 12:9). In other words, only the wicked walk round about the synagogue in order to pray. <b>Abaye said: This</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>was said only</b> in a case <b>where one does not turn his face toward the synagogue. But</b> where <b>he turns his face toward the synagogue</b> and prays <b>we have no</b> prohibition <b>in</b> that case. To reinforce the gravity of this prohibition, the Gemara relates: <b>A certain individual prayed behind the synagogue and did not turn to face the synagogue.</b> <b>Elijah</b> the Prophet <b>passed by and he saw him. He appeared to</b> him <b>as an Arab [<i>taya’a</i>].</b> Elijah <b>said: “This is how [<i>kadu bar</i>] you stand before your Master?”</b> Elijah <b>drew a sword and killed him.</b> Rav Huna already explained the beginning of the verse, “The wicked walk round about.” The Gemara explains the end of the verse: “When vileness is exalted among the sons of men.” <b>One of the Sages said to Rav Beivai bar Abaye, and some say Rav Beivai</b> said to <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak: What is</b> the meaning of: <b>“When vileness is exalted among the sons of men”?</b> <b>He said to him: These are matters of utmost importance,</b> exalted, i.e., mitzvot or prayer, <b>which people</b> nonetheless <b>treat with contempt,</b> vileness among the sons of men. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and</b> his student, <b>Rabbi Elazar, both said</b> an alternative explanation of this verse: <b>Once a person needs</b> the help of <b>others</b> and loses dignity in their eyes, vileness among the sons of men, <b>his face changes</b> and becomes <b>like a <i>kerum</i>, as it is stated: “When [<i>kerum</i>] vileness is exalted among the sons of men.”</b> <b>What is <i>kerum</i></b> referred to by Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Elazar? <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> to Babylonia from Eretz Yisrael <b>he said: There is a bird in the cities by the sea called <i>kerum</i> and when the sun rises,</b> the bird <b>changes several colors.</b> Similarly, one who becomes dependent upon others blushes in embarrassment. <b>Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi both said:</b> One who becomes dependent upon others, <b>it is as if he was punished with two punishments: Fire and water. As it is stated: “You have caused men to ride over our heads; we have gone through fire and water”</b> (Psalms 66:12). <b>And Rabbi Ḥelbo said</b> that <b>Rav Huna said: One must always be vigilant with regard to the afternoon prayer, as Elijah’s</b> prayer <b>was only answered in the afternoon prayer, as it is stated: “And it was at the time of the afternoon offering that Elijah the Prophet came near, and he said:</b> Lord, God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel, let it be known on this day that You are God in Israel, and that I am Your servant, and that I have done all these things at Your word. <b>Answer me, Lord, answer me,</b> that this people will know that You, Lord, are God” (I Kings 18:36–37). Because Elijah was answered in the afternoon prayer, it has particular significance. In passing, the Gemara explains why it was necessary for Elijah to repeat, “answer me, Lord, answer me”: The first <b>answer me</b> was the request <b>that fire descend from the heavens, while</b> the second <b>answer me</b> was the request <b>that</b> Israel should accept complete faith in God and <b>not say that</b> the fire descending from the heavens <b>was an act of sorcery.</b> <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> said: One must be vigilant <b>with regard to the evening prayer as well, as it is stated: “Let my prayer come forth as incense before You, the lifting of my hands as the evening offering”</b> (Psalms 141:2). <br><b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> One must be vigilant <b>with regard to the morning prayer as well, as it is stated: “Lord, in the morning You shall hear my voice; in the morning I will order my prayer unto You and will look forward”</b> (Psalms 5:4). <b>And Rabbi Ḥelbo said</b> that <b>Rav Huna said: Anyone who benefits from the feast of a groom but does not cause him to rejoice violates the five voices</b> mentioned in this verse, <b>as it is stated: “The voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the groom and the voice of the bride, and the voice of those who say: Give thanks to the Lord of hosts,</b> for the Lord is good, for His mercy lasts forever, even of those who bring a thanks-offering to the house of the Lord. For I will restore the captivity of the land as it was in the beginning, says the Lord” (Jeremiah 33:11). These five voices in the context of a bride and groom correspond to the five voices mentioned in the context of the revelation at Sinai, as in Song of Songs, the day of the revelation at Sinai is alluded to by the phrase: His wedding day (Rabbi Yoshiyahu Pinto, Maharsha). <b>What is his reward if he causes</b> the groom <b>to rejoice? <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said:</b> He is privileged</b> to acquire <b>the Torah, which was given with five voices, as it is stated: “And it was on the third day, when it was morning, there were sounds [<i>kolot</i>], and lightning and a thick cloud upon the mountain, and the voice of the <i>shofar</i>”</b> (Exodus 19:16). The plural <i>kolot</i> indicates at least two sounds, while “the voice of the shofar” is one more. The passage continues: <b>“And when the voice of the <i>shofar</i></b> grew louder and louder, Moses spoke <b>and God answered him by a voice”</b> (Exodus 19:19). Along with the three previous voices, the second shofar and the voice with which God answered Moses amount to a total of five voices at the revelation at Sinai. The Gemara asks: <b>Is this so? Isn’t it also written: “And the whole nation saw the voices</b> and the torches and the sound of the shofar” (Exodus 20:15)? Clearly more than five voices are mentioned with regard to the revelation at Sinai. The Gemara answers: <b>Those voices were</b> sounded <b>prior to the giving of the Torah,</b> so they are not included in this calculation of voices. <b>Rabbi Abbahu said:</b> The reward for causing a groom to rejoice <b>is</b> the same <b>as if one had offered a thanks-offering</b> in the Temple, for <b>as it is stated</b> later in the previously cited verse from Jeremiah: <b>“Those who bring a thanks-offering to the house of the Lord.”</b> <br><b>And Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> The reward for causing a groom to rejoice is the same <b>as if one rebuilt one of Jerusalem’s ruins, as it is stated</b> later in the same verse: <b>“For I will restore the captivity of the land as it was in the beginning.”</b> <b>And Rabbi Ḥelbo said</b> that <b>Rav Huna said: Any person who has the fear of Heaven, his words are heeded, as it is stated: “The end of the matter, all having been heard: Fear God,</b> and keep His commandments; for this is all of man” (Ecclesiastes 12:13). The Gemara explains: “The end of the matter, all having been heard,” refers to the words of one “who keeps His commandments; for this is all of man.” With regard to the end of this verse, the Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> meant by, <b>“for this is all of man”? Rabbi Elazar said: The Holy One, Blessed be He, said</b> about him: <b>The entire world was created only for this</b> person. This is the ultimate person for which all of man was created. <b>Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said:</b> The end of this verse teaches that <b>this is equivalent to the entire world,</b> all of man.<br><b>Rabbi Shimon ben Azzai, and some say Rabbi Shimon ben Zoma, says:</b> Not only is he the equivalent of the entire world, but <b>the entire world was created</b> to serve <b>as companions for him,</b> so that he would have a society in which to live and with which to interact. <b>And Rabbi Ḥelbo said</b> that <b>Rav Huna said: One who is aware that another</b> person <b>is accustomed to greet him</b> is not only obligated to return his greeting, but <b>he</b> must <b>greet him first, as it is stated: “Seek peace and pursue it”</b> (Psalms 34:15). <b>If</b> the other person <b>extended</b> his <b>greeting to him and he did not respond, he is called a robber, as it is stated: “It is you who have eaten up the vineyard, the spoils of the poor is in your houses”</b> (Isaiah 3:14). The only way to steal from a pauper who owns nothing is to rob him of his dignity by refusing to return his greeting. E disse Rabbi Chelbo, disse Rav Huna: Todo aquele que sabe que seu amigo costuma cumprimentá-lo com paz deve precedê-lo com paz, como está dito: \"Busque a paz e a persiga.\" E se alguém lhe der e ele não retornar — é chamado de \"ladrão,\" como está dito: \"E vocês espoliaram as vinhas, o roubo dos pobres em suas casas.\"",

      "And all are written in arm, Ravin bar Rav Adda said Rabbi Yitzḥak said: One who is accustomed to come to the synagogue and did not come one day, the Holy One, Blessed be He, asks about him, as it is stated: “Who among you fears the Lord?",
      "Who hears the voice of His servant?",
      "Though he walks in darkness and has no light, If it is for a matter a mitzva that he went there is light for him, But if it is for an optional matter, that he went there is no light for him “Let him trust in the name of the Lord.”",
      "What is the reason Because he should have relied on the name of the Lord, and he did not rely Rabbi Yoḥanan said: When the Holy One, Blessed be He, enters a synagogue and does not find ten He immediately becomes angry, as it is stated: “Why, when I came, was there no one?",
