## Annotated Text (Bold Only)

due to his wisdom, as it is written: “Say to wisdom: You are my sister” declare a firstborn permitted, He may not declare permitted.

What is the reason If we say because was not wise but we said that he was exceedingly wise.

Rather, because, he was not an expert with regard to blemishes, But didn’t **Rav**`[person]` say: I apprenticed with a shepherd **eighteen months**`[DATE]` to know which a permanent blemish, and which a temporary blemish?

Rather, to bestow honor upon **Rabba**`[person]` bar **Ḥana**`[person]`.

And if you wish, say It is due to this itself: Since **Rav**`[person]` was a great expert with regard to blemishes, he permit blemishes people do not know about.

And they would say a case like this **Rav**`[person]` declared permitted, and they would come to permit a temporary blemish, **May**`[DATE]` he teach He may teach.

If he had studied why do I to receive permission?

due to an incident that took place.

As it is taught **Rabbi**`[person]` once went to a certain place, and he saw people kneading dough in impurity, said to them:

For what are you kneading your dough in impurity?

They said to him: A certain **Torah**`[concept]` scholar came here and taught us water swamps [mei betza’im] does not render susceptible But he taught them water of eggs [**mei beitzim**`[person]`], But they thought he said: Water swamps.

And erred also with regard to this: The waters of Keramiyyon and the waters of **Piga**`[place]` are not fit since they are water swamps.

And they thought: Since is not fit water of purification, it also does not render susceptible

But it is not so, there, with regard to purification, we need: “Running water” here, rendering susceptible any renders susceptible.

It was taught: At that time, decreed: A **Torah**`[concept]` scholar may not teach unless he receives permission from his teacher **Tanḥum**`[person]`, son of **Rabbi Ami**`[person]`, arrived Ḥatar, he taught them: It is permitted to wash wheat on **Passover**`[DATE]`, They said to him: Isn’t Rabbi **Mani**`[person]` from **Tyre**`[GPE]` here

And it is taught A **Torah**`[concept]` scholar may not teach in the vicinity of his teacher, unless he is distant from **three**`[CARDINAL]` parasangs [parsaot], corresponding to the camp of **Israel**`[GPE]`.

said to them: It did not enter my mind Rabbi **Ḥiyya**`[person]` saw a certain man standing in a cemetery.

He said to him: Are you not the son of so-and-so priest?

said to him: Yes, that man’s, father was with raised eyes He set his eyes upon a divorcée and disqualified obvious partial it has been said that effective.

what conditionally?

Come hear Rabbi **Yoḥanan**`[person]` said to **Rav Shemen**`[person]`: You have our permission until you return to us.

the itself, **Shmuel**`[person]` says: **two**`[CARDINAL]` who adjudicated their judgment is judgment, but they are called an impudent court.

**Rav Naḥman**`[person]` sat and said this halakha.

**Rava**`[person]` raised an objection to **Rav Naḥman**`[person]` even **two**`[CARDINAL]` deem exempt or **two**`[CARDINAL]` deem liable and one says: I do not know, the judges must add

And if it is so they should be as **two**`[CARDINAL]` who adjudicated It is different there, as they convened from the outset with the knowledge that they are **three**`[CARDINAL]` here they did not convene with the knowledge that they are **three**`[CARDINAL]`, raised an objection to Rabban **Shimon ben Gamliel**`[PERSON]` says: law by **three**`[CARDINAL]` and compromise by **two**`[CARDINAL]` And the power of compromise is greater than the power of adjudication, as **two**`[CARDINAL]` adjudicated the litigants are able to withdraw But **two**`[CARDINAL]` a compromise, the litigants may not withdraw.
