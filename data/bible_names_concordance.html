    <div class="text-content">The Talmud asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of <b>“an offspring of men”? Rav said:</b> Hannah prayed for <b>a man among men,</b> a son who would be outstanding and exceptional. <b>And Shmuel said:</b> This expression means <b>an offspring who will anoint two men</b> to royalty. <b>And who were they? Saul and David. And R' Yoḥanan said:</b> Hannah prayed that she would bear <b>an offspring who</b> would be <b>the equivalent of two</b> of the world’s greatest <b>men. And who were they? Moses and <mark>Aaron</mark>. As it is stated: “Moses and <mark>Aaron</mark> among His priests, and Samuel among those who call His name”</b> (Psalms 99:6). In this verse, Hannah’s son, Samuel, is equated to Moses and Aaron. <b>And the Rabbis say: “An offspring of men”:</b> Hannah prayed for <b>an offspring who would be inconspicuous among men,</b> that he would not stand out in any way.</div>

    <div class="text-content">The Talmud explains: <b>In</b> conferring <b>honor, one begins with the greatest, as it is written: “And Moses said unto <mark>Aaron</mark>, and Elazar and Itamar, his remaining sons: Take</b> the meal-offering that remains” (Leviticus 10:12). Aaron, who was the greatest among those involved, is mentioned first. And <b>in cursing, one begins with the least significant,</b> as <b>first</b> the <b>snake was cursed, then Eve was cursed, and ultimately Adam</b> himself <b>was cursed.</b> The punishment did not begin with Adam.</div>

    <a class="location" href="https://chavrutai.com/talmud/berakhot/64a#section-7" target="_blank">Berakhot 64a:7</a>
    <div class="text-content"><b>And R' Avin HaLevi said: One who partakes of a meal at which a Torah scholar is present, it is as if he enjoyed the radiant splendor of the Divine Presence, as it is stated: “And <mark>Aaron</mark> came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses’ father-in-law before God”</b> (Exodus 18:12). <b>Did they</b> actually <b>eat before God? Didn’t they eat before Moses?</b></div>

  <div class="concordance-entry">
    <a class="location" href="https://chavrutai.com/talmud/shabbat/55b#section-1" target="_blank">Shabbat 55b:1</a>
    <div class="text-content">The Talmud <b>raises an objection</b> from the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>The ministering angels said before God: Master of the Universe, why did You penalize Adam, the first man, with</b> the <b>death</b> penalty? <b>He said to them: I gave him a simple mitzva, and he violated it. They said to Him: Didn’t Moses and <mark>Aaron</mark>, who observed the whole Torah in its entirety,</b> nevertheless <b>die?</b> The Holy One, Blessed be He, <b>said to them,</b> citing the verse: “All things come alike to all; <b>there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked; to the good</b> and to the clean, and to the unclean; to him who sacrifices, and to him who does not sacrifice; as is the good, so is the sinner; and he who swears, as he who fears an oath” (Ecclesiastes 9:2). Apparently, death is not dependent upon one’s actions. Everyone dies.</div>

    <div class="text-content">The Talmud answers: Rav Ami <b>stated</b> his position <b>in accordance with this <i>tanna</i>, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>R' Shimon ben Elazar said: Even Moses and <mark>Aaron</mark> died due to their sin, as it is stated:</b> “And YHWH spoke to Moses and Aaron: <b>Because you did not believe in Me</b>, to sanctify Me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore you shall not bring this congregation in to the land which I have given them” (Numbers 20:12). <b>Had you believed in Me</b> and spoken to the rock as commanded, <b>your time would not</b> yet <b>have come to leave the world.</b> Apparently, even Moses and Aaron died due to their sins.</div>

    <div class="text-content">With regard to the manner in which the Oral Law was taught, the Talmud asks: <b>They should all have studied from Moses</b> himself four times. The Talmud answers: The teaching was divided in this manner <b>in order to give honor to <mark>Aaron and his sons</mark>, and</b> also to give <b>honor to the elders.</b></div>

    <a class="location" href="https://chavrutai.com/talmud/pesachim/59a#section-4" target="_blank">Pesachim 59a:4</a>
    <div class="text-content">The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Alternatively,</b> the same verse can be interpreted as follows: <b>There is no rite that is valid from evening until morning but this one alone,</b> since all the other rites are performed only during the day. <b>What is the reason</b> that this verse is interpreted to mean that lighting the lamps is the only rite valid from evening until morning? It is because <b>the verse said</b> with regard to the candelabrum: <b>“<mark>Aaron and his sons</mark> shall set [<i>ya’arokh</i>] it [<i>oto</i>] in order,</b> to burn <b>from evening to morning.”</b> The verse uses the separate word it [<i>oto</i>], rather than a pronominal suffix attached to the word <i>ya’arokh</i> to form the word <i>ya’arkhenu</i>, in order to emphasize that <b>it,</b> the lighting of the candelabrum, <b>is from evening until morning, but no other</b> rite is <b>from evening until morning.</b></div>

  <div class="concordance-entry">
    <a class="location" href="https://chavrutai.com/talmud/pesachim/59b#section-3" target="_blank">Pesachim 59b:3</a>
    <div class="text-content"><b>Rav Ashi said to Rav Kahana, and some say it Rav Huna, son of Rav Natan,</b> said <b>to Rav Pappa: But, isn’t</b> it the case that <b>as long as the sacrificial parts</b> of the sin-offering <b>have not been burned</b> on the altar, <b>the priests may not eat the meat? As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to peace-offerings: I <b>might</b> have thought <b>that the priests would be permitted</b> to eat <b>the breast and thigh,</b> which are designated for them from the peace-offering, <b>prior to burning the sacrificial parts</b> of the offering on the altar. <b>Therefore, the verse states: “And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar,</b> and the breast shall be for Aaron and his sons” (Leviticus 7:31). From here it is derived that the priest is first obligated to burn the fat, <b>and</b> only <b>then: “The breast shall be for <mark>Aaron and his sons</mark>.</b></div>

    <div class="text-content"><b>He said to him: Since it is impossible</b> to complete the offering any other way, due to the positive <i>mitzva</i> of completion, <b>they rendered</b> these sacrificial parts <b>as ones that became ritually impure or were lost.</b> In those cases, it is permitted for priests to eat their portions. <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: I <b>might</b> have thought that <b>if the sacrificial parts became ritually impure or were lost, the priests would not be entitled to the breast and thigh,</b> the eating of which ordinarily depends upon burning the sacrificial parts on the altar. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And the breast shall be for <mark>Aaron and his sons</mark>”</b> (Leviticus 7:31), which indicates that <b>in any event</b> it is an absolute gift, even if some of the accompanying rites were not performed in the proper manner.</div>

    <div class="text-content">§ Apropos the inauguration of the priests, the Talmud asks: <b>How,</b> i.e., in what order, did Moses <b>dress</b> Aaron and his sons in the priestly vestments? The Talmud wonders: <b>In what order did he dress them?</b> That is an irrelevant question, as <b>what was, was.</b> The order in which Moses dressed the priests has no practical ramifications. <b>Rather,</b> the question must be: <b>How</b> will Moses <b>dress</b> the priests <b>in the future,</b> following the resurrection of the dead, when the Temple service will be restored? The Talmud rejects this question as well: <b>In the future, too, when <mark>Aaron and his sons</mark> will come and Moses</b> will be <b>with them,</b> he will know the proper sequence, and there is no point to raising the question.</div>

    <div class="text-content">The Talmud asks: Is the disciple <b>not</b> liable to receive the death penalty if he issues his ruling <b>not in</b> the teacher’s <b>presence? But wasn’t</b> it <b>taught</b> otherwise in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>R' Eliezer says: The sons of Aaron died only because they issued a halakhic ruling before Moses, their teacher? What did they expound</b> in support of their conclusion that they must bring fire inside as opposed to waiting for fire to come down from the heavens? It is stated in the Torah: <b>“And the sons of <mark>Aaron the priest</mark> shall put fire on the altar,</b> and lay the wood in order on the fire” (Leviticus 1:7), which led <b>them</b> to <b>say: Although fire descends from Heaven,</b> it is nonetheless <b>a mitzva to bring ordinary</b> fire.

    <a class="location" href="https://chavrutai.com/talmud/rosh-hashanah/2b#section-9" target="_blank">Rosh Hashanah 2b:9</a>
    <div class="text-content">The Talmud answers: <b>It should not enter your mind</b> to say this, <b>as it is written: “And <mark>Aaron the priest</mark> went up to Mount Hor at the commandment of YHWH, and died there, in the fortieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fifth month, on the first day of the month”</b> (Numbers 33:38), <b>and it is</b> later <b>written: “And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first of the month, that Moses spoke</b> to the children of Israel” (Deuteronomy 1:3). <b>From the fact that when</b> the Bible <b>speaks of</b> the month of <b>Av,</b> which is the fifth month, <b>it calls</b> that year <b>“the fortieth year,” and when it speaks of</b> the following <b>Shevat, it</b> also <b>calls</b> that year <b>“the fortieth year,” the implication is</b> that the <b>New Year</b> does <b>not</b> begin in <b>Tishrei.</b> Were it the case that the New Year begins in Tishrei, Av and the following Shevat would not be in the same year because the year would have changed in Tishrei.</div>

    <div class="text-content">It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of R' Yoḥanan: From where</b> is it derived <b>that one counts</b> the years of <b>kings’</b> reigns <b>only from</b> the month of <b>Nisan? As it is stated: “And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt,</b> in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month Ziv, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of YHWH” (I Kings 6:1). <b>And it is written: “And <mark>Aaron the priest</mark> went up to Mount Hor at the commandment of YHWH,</b> and died there, in the fortieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fifth month, on the first day of the month” (Numbers 33:38). <b>And it is</b> later <b>written: “And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month,</b> on the first of the month, that Moses spoke to the children of Israel” (Deuteronomy 1:3).</div>

    <div class="text-content">The Talmud answers: <b>When we said</b> that the smoke was not displaced, indicating that the wood produced smoke, that was in reference to the fire brought by a <b>person, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“And the sons of <mark>Aaron the priest</mark> shall put fire upon the altar”</b> (Leviticus 1:7), indicating that <b>even though fire descends from the heavens,</b> still there is a special <b>mitzva to bring fire by a person.</b> The fire that the priests brought produced smoke, and the miracle related to that smoke.</div>

    <div class="text-content">The Talmud asks: <b>And is</b> kindling a fire really <b>not</b> considered a Temple service? <b>But wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that it is written: <b>“And the sons of <mark>Aaron the priest</mark> shall put fire upon the altar and lay out wood in order upon the fire”</b> (Leviticus 1:7), which <b>teaches that the kindling of chips [<i>alita</i>]</b> added to keep the altar’s fire going must <b>be performed only by a proper priest and</b> that he must be wearing <b>the priestly garments?</b> This shows that kindling is considered a service. The Talmud answers: <b>Kindling</b> the <b>chips is a</b> bona fide <b>service,</b> but <b>lighting</b> the candelabrum is <b>not</b> a bona fide <b>service.</b></div>

    <div class="text-content"><b>Rav Huna said: What is the reason of R' Natan, in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai?</b> It is <b>as it is written: “And again she bore his brother [<i>et aḥiv</i>] <mark>Abel</mark> [<i>et Hevel</i>]”</b> (Genesis 4:2). The use of the superfluous word “et” indicates that she gave birth to <b><mark>Abel</mark> and his sister,</b> in addition to <b>Cain and his sister. And it states: “For God has appointed me another seed instead of <mark>Abel</mark>; for Cain slew him”</b> (Genesis 4:25).

    <div class="text-content">§ The mishna teaches that the court would say: <b>You should know</b> that cases of capital law are not like cases of monetary law, and would reference the murder of Abel by Cain. <b>Rav Yehuda, son of R' Ḥiyya, says:</b> By employing the plural term for blood, “The voice of your brother’s blood [<i>demei</i>] cries out to Me from the ground” (Genesis 4:10), the verse <b>teaches that Cain caused multiple wounds</b> and <b>multiple injuries to his brother <mark>Abel</mark>.

The verse emphasizes that the fat was sacrificed. The Talmud analyzes: <b>What is an item,</b> i.e., an offering, <b>the fat of which is sacrificed upon the altar, but</b> that <b>is not sacrificed in its entirety upon the altar?

It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated: “And Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, and she arose and destroyed all the royal descendants”</b> (II Kings 11:1). The Talmud asks: <b>But didn’t Joash remain</b> alive, and therefore, not all of David’s descendants ceased to exist? The Talmud answers: <b>There too,</b> in the massacre in Nov, <b><mark>Abiathar</mark>,</b> one of the priests, <b>remained</b> alive, <b>as it is written: “And one of the sons of Ahimelech, son of Ahitub, named <mark>Abiathar</mark>, escaped”</b> (I Samuel 22:20). <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: Were it not for</b> the fact that <b><mark>Abiathar</mark> remained</b> alive <b>for Ahimelech, son of Ahitub, there would have been no remnant or refugee remaining from the descendants of David.</b></div>

    <div class="text-content">The verse states: “And Caleb, the son of Hezron, begot children of Azubah his wife, and of Jerioth, and these were her sons: Jesher, and Shobab, and Ardon” (I Chronicles 2:18). The Talmud analyzes the verse: The verse refers to the wife of Caleb by the name <b><mark>Azubah</mark>.</b> The Sages teach that <b>this</b> is <b>Miriam. And why is she called <mark>Azubah</mark>? As everyone initially abandoned her [<i>azavuha</i>]</b> and did not want to marry her because she was sickly and unattractive. The verse additionally states: “And Caleb, the son of Hezron, <b>begot children [<i>holid</i>]</b> of Azubah his wife” (I Chronicles 2:18). The Talmud asks: Why use the term “<i>holid</i>,” begot children? <b>But</b> doesn’t this verse state that <b>he married her? R' Yoḥanan says:</b> This teaches us that with regard to <b>anyone who marries a woman for the sake of Heaven,</b> as he married her due to her righteousness without concern for her appearance, <b>the verse ascribes him</b> credit <b>as if he gave birth to her.</b></div>

    <div class="text-content">The Talmud asks: <b>Rather, from where do we</b> derive that in earlier generations men fathered children at the age of eight? <b>From here,</b> as it is written: <b>“And Bezalel, son of Uri, son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah,</b> made all that YHWH commanded Moses” (Exodus 38:22). <b>And it is written: “And <mark>Azubah</mark> died, and Caleb took for himself Ephrat, who bore him Hur.</b> And Hur begot Uri, and Uri begot Bezalel” (I Chronicles 2:19–20). <b>And when Bezalel made the Tabernacle how old was he?</b> He must have been at least <b>thirteen years old, as it is written:</b> “And all the wise men that carried out all the work of the sanctuary, came <b>every man from his work that they did”</b> (Exodus 36:4), and one who is less than thirteen is not called a man. <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>In the first year</b> following the exodus from Egypt <b>Moses made the Tabernacle; in the second</b> year <b>he erected the Tabernacle and sent out the spies.</b></div>

    <div class="text-content">§ Incidental to the exposition of the word <i>Yehudi</i> as one who repudiates idolatry, the Talmud relates that <b>when R' Shimon ben Pazi introduced</b> his exposition of <b>the book of Chronicles, he</b> addressed the book of Chronicles and <b>said as follows: All of your words are one, and we know how to expound them.</b> This introduction made reference to the fact that the book of Chronicles cannot always be interpreted literally but requires exposition, as the same individual might be called by various different names, as in the following verse: <b>“And his wife <i>HaYehudiyya</i> bore Jered the father of Gedor, and Heber the father of Soco, and Jekuthiel the father of Zanoah.

    <div class="text-content">With regard to the incident with Hillel, <b>Rav Yehuda said that Rav said: Anyone who acts haughtily, if he is a</b> Torah <b>scholar, his wisdom departs from him;</b> and <b>if he is a prophet, his prophecy departs from him.</b> The Talmud explains: That <b>if he is a</b> Torah <b>scholar, his wisdom departs from him</b> is learned <b>from Hillel, for the Master said</b> in this <i>baraita</i>: Hillel <b>began to rebuke them with words.</b> Because he acted haughtily, he ended up <b>saying to them: I</b> once <b>heard this <i>halakha</i>, but I have forgotten</b> it, as he was punished for his haughtiness by forgetting the law. That <b>if he is a prophet his prophecy departs from him</b> is learned <b>from <mark>Deborah</mark>, as it is written: “The villagers ceased, they ceased in Israel, until I, <mark>Deborah</mark>, arose, I arose a mother in Israel”</b> (Judges 5:7). For these words of self-glorification, Deborah was punished with a loss of her prophetic spirit, <b>as it is written</b> later that it was necessary to say to her: <b>“Awake, awake, <mark>Deborah</mark>; awake, awake, utter a song”</b> (Judges 5:12), because her prophecy had left her.</div>

    <div class="text-content">The Talmud continues its explanation: <b>And from where do we</b> derive that betrothal is accomplished by means of giving <b>money?</b> It is <b>derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between the term expressing <b>taking</b> stated with regard to betrothal and <b>from</b> the term expressing <b>taking</b> with regard to <b>the field of <mark>Ephron</mark>.</b> How so? <b>It is written here,</b> with regard to marriage: <b>“When a man takes a woman”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1), <b>and it is written there,</b> concerning Abraham’s purchase of the field of the Cave of Machpelah from Ephron the Hittite: <b>“I will give money for the field; take it from me”</b> (Genesis 23:13).

    <div class="text-content">The Talmud answers: The number serves <b>to exclude</b> acquisition through symbolic <b>exchange,</b> i.e., a <i>pro forma</i> act of acquisition effecting the transfer of ownership of an article. Although a woman can be betrothed by means of money or an item of monetary value, she is not betrothed if she is given an item by symbolic exchange. The Talmud explains why this needs to be excluded: It might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since</b> the Sages <b>derive</b> the acquisition of a woman by verbal analogy between the term expressing <b>taking</b> stated with regard to betrothal <b>from</b> the term expressing <b>taking</b> with regard to <b>the field of <mark>Ephron</mark>,</b> it can be suggested that <b>just as a field can be acquired through</b> symbolic <b>exchange, so too, a woman can be acquired through</b> symbolic <b>exchange.</b> Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us</b> that this is not the case.</div>

This is <b>the statement of R' Eliezer. They said to him: These</b> acts <b>are nothing other</b> than acts <b>similar to those of <mark>Er and Onan</mark>,</b> which are prohibited. Regardless, it can be deduced from here that Er and Onan engaged in normative sexual intercourse with Tamar, only they did not fully complete the sexual act.</div>

    <div class="text-content">After this discussion of the statement that R' Elazar said that R' Avina said, another statement of R' Elazar is cited. <b>R' Elazar bar Avina said: What was said about</b> the angel <b>Michael is greater than what was said about</b> the angel <b><mark>Gabriel</mark>. As about Michael, it is written: “And one of the seraphim flew to me”</b> (Isaiah 6:6), indicating that with a single flight, the seraph arrived and performed his mission, while <b>regarding <mark>Gabriel</mark>, it is written: “The man, <mark>Gabriel</mark>, whom I had seen at the beginning, in a vision, being caused to fly swiftly,</b> approached close to me about the time of the evening offering” (Daniel 9:21). The double language used in the phrase “to fly swiftly [<i>muaf biaf]</i>,” indicates that he did not arrive at his destination in a single flight, but rather, that it took him two flights.</div>

Because it told [<i>maggid</i>] the Jewish people</b> the answer to issues of uncertainty, such as the paternity of a baby. If a woman remarries within two months after her divorce or the death of her husband and gives birth seven months after her remarriage, it is unclear if the baby gestated for seven months and is the son of the second husband or for nine months and is the son of the first husband. The manna would tell them <b>if</b> the baby was born after <b>nine</b> months and belongs to the <b>first</b> husband, <b>or if</b> the baby was born after <b>seven</b> months and belongs to the <b>second</b> husband. Since the manna was collected by each family based on the number of its biological members, the manna established the baby’s paternity.</div>

    <div class="text-content">The Talmud discusses the <i>baraita</i>: One who says: It is incumbent upon me that I will not eat meat and that I will not drink wine <b>like</b> on <b>the day that his father died.</b> The Talmud asks: Isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that he is prohibited from eating meat and drinking wine? Why does the <i>baraita</i> need to mention the specific example of a vow concerning the day his father died? The Talmud answers: It <b>was necessary</b> that the <i>baraita</i> state that the vow takes effect for the sake of the other example: <b>Like</b> on <b>the day that <mark>Gedaliah ben Ahikam</mark> was killed.</b> Otherwise, it <b>may enter your mind to say: Since,</b> even <b>if he did not vow</b> to refrain from eating meat or drinking wine on that day <b>they would be prohibited to him anyway,</b> as it is a public fast day, <b>when he did vow</b> to refrain from eating and drinking on that day, the <b>prohibition</b> of the vow <b>would not take effect on him, and that</b> subsequent vow would then <b>not be associated with a vow,</b> but with an ordinary prohibition.

    <div class="text-content"><b>R' Shimon ben Pazi said</b> that <b>R' Yehoshua ben Levi said in the name of bar Kappara: Anyone who fulfills</b> the obligation to eat <b>three meals on Shabbat is rescued from three punishments: From the pangs of the Messiah,</b> i.e., the suffering that precedes the advent of Messiah, <b>and from the judgment of Gehenna, and from the war of <mark>Gog and Magog</mark>.</b> The Talmud derives that one is rescued <b>from the pangs of Messiah</b> by means of a verbal analogy. <b>It is written here,</b> with regard to Shabbat, <b>day:</b> “Eat it today” (Exodus 16:25). <b>And it is written there,</b> with regard to Messiah, day: <b>“Behold, I am sending you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the</b> great and awesome <b>day</b> of God” (Malachi 3:23). The Talmud derives that one is rescued <b>from the judgment of Gehenna</b> by means of a verbal analogy. <b>It is written here,</b> with regard to Shabbat, <b>day,</b> as cited above. <b>And it is written there,</b> day: <b>“That day will be a day of wrath,</b> a day of trouble and distress, a day of destruction and desolation, a day of darkness and blackness, a day of cloud and thick fog” (Zephaniah 1:15), which is interpreted as referring to the punishment of Gehenna. The Talmud derives that one is rescued <b>from the war of <mark>Gog and Magog</mark></b> by means of a verbal analogy. <b>It is written here,</b> with regard to Shabbat, <b>day.

And why was she called Iscah? For she saw [<i>sakhta</i>] by means of divine inspiration, as it is stated: “In all that Sarah has said to you, hearken to her voice”</b> (Genesis 21:12). <b>Alternatively,</b> Sarah was also called <b>Iscah, for all gazed [<i>sokhin</i>] upon her beauty.</b></div>

    <div class="text-content">The mishna teaches: <b>And no one may marry</b> the king’s widow, and R' Yehuda says that a king may marry another king’s widow, as proven by King David, who was promised with regard to King Saul after his death: “And I have given you the house of your master and the wives of your master” (II Samuel 12:8). <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The Sages <b>said to R' Yehuda:</b> The meaning of the verse is not that David married Saul’s widows, but that he married <b>women appropriate for him from the house of the king.

    <div class="text-content"><b>Alternatively,</b> is it possible that <b><mark>Micah</mark>’s idol stood in tears, and the Jewish people</b> were <b>reciting <i>hallel</i></b> before it? The reference is to the idol of Micah, which was still standing in the days of David (see Judges 17). The Talmud states that the idol was crying, as a euphemism for its laughter, to avoid shaming the Jewish people (<i>ge’onim</i>). The point is that the Jews would not have chanted: “They who make them shall be like them” (Psalms 115:8) at a time that they were worshipping idols. Rather, <i>hallel</i> must be older than that, and it dates back to the Song at the Sea.</div>

The Talmud asks: <b>Consider: Hosea preceded</b> some of the other prophets whose books are included in the Bible, <b>as it is written: “The Lord spoke first to Hosea”</b> (Hosea 1:2). At first glance this verse is difficult: <b>But did God speak first with Hosea,</b> and not with any other prophet before him? <b>Weren’t there many prophets between Moses and Hosea? And R' Yoḥanan says: He was the first of four prophets who prophesied in that period, and they were: Hosea and Isaiah, Amos and <mark>Micah</mark>.</b> Accordingly, Hosea preceded those three prophets; <b>and</b> the book of <b>Hosea</b> as well <b>should precede</b> the books of those prophets.</div>

Wasn’t it taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i> pertaining to the laws of ritual impurity that <b>R' Shimon ben Elazar says: <mark>Og</mark>, king of the Bashan,</b> or any similar giant, requires an <b>opening as</b> big as <b>his full size?</b> If a person dies in a house and it is not clear how his corpse will be removed, all of the openings in the house are considered ritually impure, as the corpse might be carried out through any one of them. If the corpse can fit through some of the openings but not through others, only the larger openings are ritually impure. R' Shimon ben Elazar says that in the case of a giant the size of Og, king of the Bashan, one opening can only prevent the others from contracting impurity if it is large enough for Og’s corpse to fit through. This indicates that the law is determined by the measure of each particular person and not by some general measure.</div>

The Talmud teaches: A separate verse relates that after the evil king Ahab was killed: <b>“And the song went throughout the camp”</b> (I Kings 22:36). <b>R' Aḥa bar Ḥanina says:</b> The fact that the verse states “the song,” and not a song, indicates that it is referring to a song mentioned elsewhere.

    <div class="text-content"><b>for</b> all the <b><mark>seed of Aaron</mark>,</b> both sons and daughters? <b>You must say it is <i>teruma</i>.</b> The Talmud raises a difficulty: <b>But say</b> that perhaps the verse is referring to <b>the breast and thigh</b> of a peace-offering, which also may be eaten by all the seed of Aaron, both male and female? The Talmud answers: The breast and thigh are not permitted to males and females in equal manner, as they <b>are not</b> permitted <b>to</b> the daughter of a priest <b>who returns</b> to the home of her father. If the daughter of a priest marries a non-priest, it is prohibited for her to partake of <i>teruma</i> or sacrificial food.

    <div class="text-content">Concerning throwing an object on Shabbat from one domain to another and within a single domain, the Talmud raises several issues with regard to intention when throwing. It is <b>obvious</b> that <b>one who intended to throw</b> an object <b>eight</b> cubits in a public domain <b>and</b> actually <b>threw</b> it only <b>four</b> cubits is liable <b>because</b> that case is similar to a case where <b>one wrote</b> the word <b><i><mark>shem</mark></i>,</b> the first two letters <b>of</b> the name <b>Shimon.</b> In the case of writing <i>shem</i>, the individual performed the prohibited labor of writing a two-letter word, even though he did not complete the word that he originally intended to write. The question is as follows: <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> if <b>one intended to throw</b> an object <b>four</b> cubits <b>and threw</b> it <b>eight? Do we say he did</b> indeed <b>carry</b> the object, <b>or perhaps</b> we say that ultimately the object <b>did not land where he wanted</b> it to land? <b>But</b> is <b>that not</b> precisely what <b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi,</b> as mentioned above? <b>And</b> Rav Ashi <b>said</b> in response that it is referring to a case <b>where one says: Any place that it wants to</b> come to rest, let it come to <b>rest.</b> In such a scenario one is liable, because he expressed the fact that he is contented with any labor that will be performed with the object.</div>

    <div class="text-content"><b>R' Elazar says:</b> The verse means <b>that</b> Tamar <b>covered her face in the home of her father-in-law,</b> Judah. Therefore, he did not recognize her when her face was uncovered. <b>As R' Shmuel bar Naḥmani says</b> that <b>R' Yonatan says: Any daughter-in-law who is modest in the house of her father-in-law merits that kings and prophets emerge from her. From where do we</b> derive this? <b>From Tamar. Prophets</b> emerged from her, <b>as it is written: “The vision of Isaiah, the <mark>son of Amoz</mark>”</b> (Isaiah 1:1). <b>Kings</b> emerged from her, as seen <b>from David.

    <div class="text-content">A <i>tanna</i> <b>taught:</b> It was <b>not for nothing</b> that specifically <b>Pinehas went to war</b> with Midian; <b>rather,</b> it was <b>to exact</b> the rightful <b>judgment of his mother’s father,</b> Joseph, <b>as it is stated: “And the Midianites sold him into Egypt</b> to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh’s” (Genesis 37:36). The Talmud asks: <b>Is this to say that Pinehas came,</b> on his mother’s side, <b>from</b> the family of <b>Joseph? But it is written: “And Elazar, Aaron’s son, took himself a wife from the daughters of Putiel;</b> and she bore him Pinehas” (Exodus 6:25). <b>What, is it not that</b> Pinehas <b>came from</b> the family of <b><mark>Yitro</mark>, who</b> was also called Putiel because he <b>fattened [<i>pittem</i>] calves for idol worship?</b> They answer: <b>No;</b> he was descended <b>from Joseph, who mocked [<i>pitpet</i>] his desire</b> by resisting the advances of Potiphar’s wife.</div>

    <div class="text-content">The Talmud asks: <b>But is it not</b> the case that, according to an oral tradition, <b>the tribes</b> were <b>denigrating</b> Pinehas after he killed Zimri, saying: Did <b>you see this son of Puti, the son whose mother’s father fattened cows for idol worship?</b> Should this man <b>kill a prince of Israel?</b> Evidently, his grandfather Puti was Yitro, not Joseph. The Talmud answers: <b>Rather,</b> Pinehas was descended from both Joseph and Yitro. <b>If his mother’s father</b> descended <b>from Joseph, his mother’s mother</b> descended <b>from <mark>Yitro</mark>. And if his mother’s mother</b> descended <b>from Joseph, his mother’s father</b> descended <b>from <mark>Yitro</mark>.</b> The Talmud confirms this resolution: The language <b>is also precise, as it is written:</b> Elazar took a wife <b>“from the daughters of Putiel,”</b> which <b>implies</b> that she came from <b>two</b> daughters of men named Putiel. The Talmud concludes: You may <b>learn from</b> the verse that this is so.</div>

And</b> elsewhere <b>it is written: “And the sons of Zerah were <mark>Zimri</mark> and Ethan and Heman and Calcol and Dara, five of them in all”</b> (I Chronicles 2:6). <b>What</b> do the words <b>“five of them in all”</b> serve to teach? <b>All five</b> sons <b>are</b> destined <b>to</b> receive a share in <b>the World-to-Come.</b> According to the Sages, Zimri is Achan, son of Zerah, as will be explained. Since Achan has a share in the World-to-Come, his confession must have achieved atonement for him.</div>

    <div class="text-content">In one place, among the five sons of Zerah, <b>it is written: “<mark>Zimri</mark>,”</b> without any mention of Achan (I Chronicles 2:6), <b>and</b> in another place <b>it is written:</b> “And Joshua took <b>Achan,</b> son of Zerah” (Joshua 7:24). <b>Rav and Shmuel</b> both say that Zimri and Achan are one and the same, but they disagree about his real name. <b>One</b> of them <b>says: His</b> real <b>name was Achan. Why</b> then <b>was he called <mark>Zimri</mark>?</b> He was called Zimri <b>because he acted like <mark>Zimri</mark>,</b> i.e., just as Zimri engaged in sexual intercourse with a Midianite woman, Achan engaged in intercourse with a betrothed young woman. <b>And</b> the other <b>one says: His</b> real <b>name was <mark>Zimri</mark>.

    <div class="text-content">The Talmud notes: <b>Similarly, you can explain</b> the verse: “And Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses <b>due to the Cushite woman whom he had married,</b> for he had taken a Cushite woman” (Numbers 12:1). <b>But is her name Cushite? <mark>Zipporah</mark> is her name.

    <div class="text-content"><b>R' Yehuda bar Bizna taught: At the time that Moses our teacher was negligent about the circumcision,</b> the destructive angels named <b>Af,</b> meaning anger, <b>and Ḥeima,</b> meaning wrath, <b>came and swallowed him, and only his legs were left</b> outside. <b>Immediately, “<mark>Zipporah</mark> took a flint, and cut off the foreskin of her son”</b> (Exodus 4:25), and <b>immediately “He let him alone”</b> (Exodus 4:26).</div>

    <div class="text-content">The Talmud raises a difficulty against this explanation: <b>And is there anyone who says</b> that <b>a woman may not</b> perform circumcision? <b>But isn’t it written: “Then <mark>Zipporah</mark> took [<i>vattikka?</i>] a flint</b> and cut off the foreskin of her son” (Exodus 4:25). This verse explicitly states that a circumcision was performed by a woman. The Talmud answers that one should <b>read into</b> the verse: <b>And she caused to be taken [<i>vattakka?</i>],</b> i.e., she did not take a flint herself. <b>But isn’t it written: And she cut off [<i>vattikhrot</i>]? Read into</b> the verse: <b>And she caused to be cut off [<i>vattakhret</i>], as she told another person</b> to take a flint and cut off her son’s foreskin, <b>and he did</b> so. The Talmud provides an alternative explanation: <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>She came and began</b> the act, <b>and Moses came and completed</b> the circumcision.</div>

    <div class="text-content">The Talmud <b>raises an objection</b> from another <i>baraita</i> against the notion that Job was a Jew: <b>Seven prophets prophesied to the nations of the world, and they are: Balaam and his father</b> Beor, <b>and Job, Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and <mark>Zophar the Naamathite</mark>, and Elihu ben Barachel the Buzite,</b> which indicates that Job was not Jewish. <b>He said to him: And according to your reasoning</b> that Job could not have been Jewish because he prophesied to the nations of the world, <b>was Elihu ben Barachel not a Jew?
