The Gemara answers: This is <b>as the Sages taught:</b> The verse states: <b>“The owner of the house shall come near the court,</b> to see whether he has not put his hand upon his neighbor’s property” (Exodus 22:7), so <b>there is one</b> judge <b>here.</b> The following verse states: <b>“The cause of both parties shall come before the court,”</b> so <b>there are two</b> judges <b>here.</b> And that verse concludes: <b>“He whom the court shall condemn</b> shall pay double to his neighbor,” so <b>there are three</b> judges <b>here,</b> corresponding to the three mentions of the term “the court.” This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yoshiya.</b> <b>Rabbi Yonatan says: The first</b> instance of the term “the court” <b>is stated first</b> as part of the primary text of the passage, and it is necessary for conveying the straightforward meaning of the verse. <b>And one does not derive</b> tallies for halakhic matters by counting the <b>first</b> mention of a term. Rabbi Yonatan holds that when a tally is derived from the number of instances a certain word appears in the Torah, the first instance is not included in the tally, as it is necessary to teach the mitzva itself; the tally may be counted only from subsequent mentions. <b>Rather,</b> this is how it is derived: <b>“The cause of both parties shall come before the court,” there is one</b> judge <b>here,</b> and the continuation of the verse: <b>“He whom the court shall condemn”</b> teaches that <b>there are two</b> judges <b>here. And</b> since <b>a court may not</b> be composed of <b>an even</b> number of judges, <b>they</b> must <b>add an additional one to them,</b> so <b>there are three</b> judges <b>here.</b> <b>Let us say</b> that Rabbi Yoshiya and Rabbi Yonatan <b>disagree with regard to</b> whether <b>one derives</b> tallies for halakhic matters from the <b>first</b> mention of a term in the Torah. <b>As</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yoshiya, <b>holds</b> that <b>one derives</b> tallies from the <b>first</b> mention of the term in the Torah, <b>and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yonatan, <b>holds</b> that <b>one does not derive</b> tallies from the <b>first</b> mention of the term. The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>No,</b> actually <b>everyone</b> holds that <b>one does not derive</b> tallies from the <b>first</b> mention of the term, but in this case there is a separate source for the derivation, as <b>Rabbi Yoshiya</b> could have <b>said to you: If it is true</b> that no <i>halakha</i> is derived from the first mention, <b>let the verse say: The owner of the house shall come near to the judge [<i>hashofet</i>]. What,</b> then, is the significance of the unique expression: <b>“To the court [<i>haelohim</i>]”? Conclude from it</b> that the term <i>elohim</i> was chosen <b>to</b> count toward <b>the tally.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how would <b>Rabbi Yonatan</b> respond to this analysis? The Gemara answers: He would say that the verse <b>employed the</b> common <b>language of the world, as people say: One who has a case,</b> a claim against another, <b>should approach the</b> regular <b>judge,</b> the one who generally judges cases and can be referred to by the term <i>elohim</i>. Consequently, no unique <i>halakha</i> can be derived from this first usage. <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Yoshiya accept</b> the principle that <b>a court</b> must be composed of <b>an odd</b> number of judges? <b>And isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, says: What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “To incline after a multitude to pervert justice”</b> (Exodus 23:2)? The meaning is that <b>the Torah is saying</b> to you: <b>Make for yourself a court</b> that is composed of an odd number of judges, that will perforce <b>incline</b> in one direction, so that there will always be a majority that can be followed. The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yoshiya does not accept this <i>halakha</i> but instead <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who says:</b> A Great Sanhedrin is composed of <b>seventy</b> judges. <b>As we learned</b> in the mishna: The <b>Great Sanhedrin was</b> composed <b>of seventy-one</b> judges, and <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> It is composed of <b>seventy</b> judges. Clearly, Rabbi Yehuda does not accept the principle that a court must be composed of an odd number of judges. The Gemara asks: <b>Say that you heard</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> said this <i>halakha</i> with regard <b>to the Great Sanhedrin,</b> about <b>which</b> specific <b>verses are written,</b> and he derives from these verses that the Great Sanhedrin must be composed of exactly seventy judges. <b>Have you heard him</b> say <b>with regard to the rest of the courts,</b> those whose composition is not explicitly addressed in the Torah, that these courts can also be composed of an even number of judges? <b>And if you would say: There is no difference;</b> Rabbi Yehuda does not differentiate between the Great Sanhedrin and lower courts, <b>but didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: The <b>laying of hands by the Sages and the breaking of the heifer’s neck</b> are performed in front of a panel <b>of three</b> judges; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Shimon. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> These rituals are performed in front <b>of five</b> judges. <b>And we say</b> with regard to this <i>halakha</i>: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yehuda?</b> The verse states: “And the Elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock” (Leviticus 4:15). The term: <b>“Shall lay their hands,”</b> which is in the plural, indicates that there are <b>two,</b> and the word <b>“Elders,”</b> which is also plural, indicates another <b>two,</b> meaning a total of four. <b>And</b> since <b>a court may not</b> be composed of <b>an even</b> number of judges, <b>we add another one to them,</b> and <b>there are five</b> judges <b>here.</b> Consequently, Rabbi Yehuda does accept the <i>halakha</i> that a court may not be composed of an even number of judges. The Gemara answers: It can be explained <b>that Rabbi Yoshiya</b> holds in accordance with the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda</b> but <b>goes further than</b> he does. This is <b>because Rabbi Yehuda does not accept</b> the principle that a court must be composed of an odd number of judges in connection <b>with a Great Sanhedrin, but with regard to other courts he does accept</b> it. <b>And Rabbi Yoshiya also does not accept</b> it <b>with regard to other courts.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And what does he do with this</b> verse: <b>“To incline</b> after a multitude to pervert justice”? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yoshiya <b>interprets it in</b> relation to cases of <b>capital law.</b> In such cases he agrees that the court must be composed of an odd number of judges, in order that it will be possible to exonerate the accused on the basis of a majority of one judge. The Gemara asks: <b>But does</b> Rabbi Yoshiya <b>not</b> accept the requirement for an odd number of judges <b>with regard to</b> cases of <b>monetary law? But</b> there is <b>that which we learned</b> in a mishna (29a): If <b>two</b> judges <b>say</b> the defendant is <b>exempt</b> from payment <b>and one says</b> he is <b>liable,</b> he is <b>exempt;</b> if <b>two say</b> he is <b>liable and one says</b> he is <b>exempt,</b> he is <b>liable. Let us say that</b> this mishna is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoshiya,</b> as Rabbi Yoshiya does not accept the requirement for an odd number of judges concerning cases of monetary law, and therefore perhaps he holds that the verdict must be agreed upon unanimously by all the judges. The Gemara rejects this possibility: <b>You</b> may <b>even say</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoshiya.</b> Although he does not accept the requirement for an odd number of judges in cases of monetary law, he does allow for a decision on the basis of a majority. <b>He derives this</b> principle based <b>on an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from</b> cases of <b>capital law: If</b> concerning cases of <b>capital law, which are strict, the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: <b>Follow the majority,</b> and does not require a unanimous ruling, concerning cases of <b>monetary law,</b> which are more lenient, is it <b>not all the more so</b> clear that a majority ruling is sufficient? § <b>The Sages taught:</b> Cases concerning <b>monetary law</b> are adjudicated <b>by three</b> judges. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> They are adjudicated <b>by five</b> judges, <b>so that a verdict can be issued with three</b> judges. The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say</b> that with a court <b>of three</b> judges <b>a verdict cannot be issued by two</b> judges? The Gemara answers: <b>This is</b> what Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>is saying:</b> Cases of monetary law are adjudicated by five judges, <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that a verdict</b> must be issued <b>by three.</b> In other words, according to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi the judges who form the majority that decides the verdict must themselves be eligible to constitute a court. <b>Evidently,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds</b> that <b>when</b> the requirement for <b>three</b> judges <b>is written</b> in the Torah, it <b>is written with regard to</b> the number of judges necessary to issue <b>the verdict.</b> <b>Rabbi Abbahu</b> would <b>ridicule [<i>megaddef</i> ] this</b> suggestion. <b>If that is so,</b> then <b>the Great Sanhedrin would need</b> to consist of <b>141</b> judges, <b>so that the verdict can be issued by seventy-one, and a lesser Sanhedrin would need</b> to consist of <b>forty-five</b> judges, <b>so that the verdict can be issued by twenty-three.</b> But these assertions contradict the <i>halakha</i> as derived from the verses. <b>Rather, the Merciful One states: “Gather Me seventy men</b> of the Elders of Israel” (Numbers 11:16), and this means that <b>from the time of gathering,</b> there must be <b>seventy.</b> Likewise, the verse states: <b>“And the congregation shall judge…and the congregation shall save”</b> (Numbers 35:24–25), from which it is derived that cases of capital law are adjudicated by twenty-three judges, and this <b>also</b> means that <b>from the time that the congregation judges</b> there must be twenty-three. <b>Similarly,</b> with regard to a case of monetary law, the verse states: <b>“The owner of the house shall come near to the court”</b> (Exodus 22:7), and this means <b>from the time of coming near</b> to judge the cases there must be <b>three</b> judges. Consequently, there is no requirement that the verdict be decided by a majority who could themselves form a court. Therefore, the previous explanation must be rejected. <b>Rather, this is the reasoning of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi: It is stated in the next verse: <b>“He whom the court shall condemn”</b> (Exodus 22:8) in the plural, which means there must be <b>two</b> judges. Consequently, <b>it is stated: “The court,”</b> in the verse <b>below and it is stated: “The court,”</b> in the verse <b>above. Just as below</b> it is referring to <b>two</b> judges, as the word: “Shall condemn,” is written in the plural, <b>so too above</b> it is referring to <b>two</b> judges, making a total of four. <b>And</b> since <b>a court may not</b> be composed of <b>an even</b> number of judges, <b>they add another one to them, so there are five</b> judges <b>here.</b>",
