Actually, hold in accordance with **Rabban Gamliel**`[person]`, that they say until **midnight**`[TIME]` is to distance a person from transgression.

As it was taught the Rabbis created a “fence” for their pronouncements in order to prevent a person comes home from the field in the evening, says I will go home, eat a little, drink a little, sleep a little

and then I will recite and recite he is overcome by sleep and ends up sleeping **all night**`[TIME]`.

However, he will come from the field in the evening, enter the synagogue, If he is accustomed to reading the Bible, he reads.

If he is accustomed to learning he learns.

And he recites and prays he eats his meal and recites a blessing.

Anyone who transgresses the pronouncements of the Sages is liable to death What is different in all places that it is not taught that one is liable the death penalty and what is different here that it is taught that he is liable to death penalty?

If you wish, say overcome by sleep, And if you wish, say to exclude he who says that the **evening**`[TIME]` prayer is optional.

it teaches us is mandatory, the Master said recites **Shema**`[concept]`, and prays.

supports **Rabbi Yoḥanan**`[person]`, as **Rabbi Yoḥanan**`[person]` said: Who of the World-to-Come?

It is who juxtaposes redemption, to the **evening**`[TIME]` prayer.

Rabbi **Yehoshua ben Levi**`[person]` says: The prayers were instituted between With regard to what do they disagree?

If you wish, say a verse; if you wish, say logic.

If you say logic, **Rabbi Yoḥanan**`[person]` holds: Redemption occurred in the evening as well; the full-fledged redemption was only in the morning.

Rabbi **Yehoshua ben Levi**`[person]`, holds: Since only occurred in **the morning**`[TIME]`, was not a full-fledged redemption, And if you wish, say a verse.

Both derived their opinions from the same verse: “When you lie down, and when you rise.”

Rabbi **Yoḥanan**`[person]` holds: juxtaposes lying down and rising.

Just as when **one**`[CARDINAL]` rises, the recitation of is followed by prayer, so too, when one lies down, the recitation of is followed by prayer.

And Rabbi **Yehoshua ben Levi**`[person]` maintains: juxtaposes lying down and rising Just as when **one**`[CARDINAL]` rises, adjacent to his bed, so too when one lies down, he recites adjacent to his bed.

Mar, son of **Ravina**`[person]`, raises an objection In **the evening**`[TIME]`, one recites **two**`[CARDINAL]` prior to and **two**`[CARDINAL]` afterward.

And if you say one must juxtapose doesn’t he fail to juxtapose redemption to prayer, as he must recite: Help us lie down

[hashkivenu], They say Since the Sages instituted Help us lie down, it is considered one extended blessing of redemption, As if you fail to say then can one juxtapose redemption to prayer in the morning?

Didn’t **Rabbi Yoḥanan**`[person]` say: Before one recites “Lord, open my lips, that my mouth may declare Your glory” Afterward, one recites “May the words of my mouth and the meditations of my heart be acceptable before You” Rather, there, since the Sages instituted recite: Lord, open my lips, it is considered as an extended prayer Here, too, since the Sages instituted to recite Help us lie down, it is considered as one extended redemption.

Rabbi **Elazar**`[person]` said **Rabbi Avina**`[person]` said: Anyone who recites: “A Psalm of David” **three**`[CARDINAL]` times every day is assured of the World-to-Come.

What is the reason If you say that it is because it is arranged alphabetically, let us say: “Happy are they who are upright in the way” where appears **eight**`[CARDINAL]` times Rather, because it contains “You open Your hand let him recite the great hallel in which written, “Who provides food to all flesh, Rather, is because it contains both **Rabbi Yoḥanan**`[person]` said: Why is there no nun in ashrei?

Because it contains the downfall of the enemies of **Israel**`[GPE]`, As it is written: “The virgin of **Israel**`[GPE]` has fallen and she will rise no more; in the **West**`[place]`, they interpreted it “She has fallen but she shall fall no more; rise, virgin of **Israel**`[GPE]`.”

**Rav Naḥman**`[person]` bar **Yitzḥak**`[person]` Even so, **David**`[PERSON]` went and support, through divine inspiration.

“The Lord upholds the fallen **Rabbi Elazar**`[person]` bar Avina said: What was said about **Michael**`[PERSON]` is greater than what was said about **Gabriel**`[person]`.

As about **Michael**`[PERSON]`, it is written: “And **one**`[CARDINAL]` of the seraphim flew to me” regarding **Gabriel**`[person]`, it is written: “The man, **Gabriel**`[person]`, whom I had seen at the beginning, in a vision, being caused to fly swiftly, From where is it inferred that the one is **Michael**`[PERSON]`?

Rabbi **Yoḥanan**`[person]` said: This is derived **one**`[CARDINAL]` and one.

Here, it is written: “And **one**`[CARDINAL]` of the seraphim flew to me” and there, it is written: “And behold, **Michael**`[PERSON]`, **one**`[CARDINAL]` of the chief ministers of the king, came to my aid” It was taught **Michael**`[PERSON]`, in **one**`[CARDINAL]` **Gabriel**`[person]`, in **two**`[CARDINAL]` **Elijah**`[PERSON]` in **four**`[CARDINAL]` and the Angel of Death, in **eight**`[CARDINAL]` During a time of plague, in **one**`[CARDINAL]` Rabbi **Yehoshua ben Levi**`[person]` said: Even though one recited **Shema**`[concept]` in the synagogue, it is a mitzva to recite it upon his bed **Rabbi Yosei**`[person]` said: What verse “Tremble, and do not sin; say to your heart upon your bed and be still, **Selah**`[person]`” Rabbi **Naḥman**`[person]` said:
